Studies have already shown the usefulness of machine learning in demolition waste estimation; however, application to real-world datasets is still limited. This study tests the feasibility of predicting recoverable material stock in the local context of the city of Zurich. The results show promise for the overall approach, although training models by using a small and heterogeneous dataset poses challenges. Therefore, we conceptualized an improved demolition data collection, processing, and dissemination. The resulting framework could help researchers and authorities in urban material stock estimation.},

	abstract     = {With the current trend of using Linked Data to describe buildings during their entire lifecycles, the importance of product descriptions in a Semantic Web context is growing while most product ontologies are designed for mass-produced goods of little variance. But especially in the construction industry, products are often innovative and individually manufactured and previous attempts to depict them with ontologies failed to include meaningful alignments to already existing approaches. Thus, this paper gives an overview of existing product ontologies in general and analyses previous approaches in more detail to identify potential improvements that can be made. Based on this analysis, this paper presents the Building Product Ontology (BPO), including its concepts and alignments. To obtain a modular ontology, the BPO focuses on the non-geometric description without defining templates by determination of taxonomies and includes concepts to model assembly structures, interconnections of components, and complex properties and property values. The BPO enables manufacturers to freely model their products while still benefitting from the Semantic Web in respects of findability and availability of product data. By going through the given examples and demonstrations, inexperienced users are supported to apply the BPO and exploit its benefits.},

	abstract     = {In contrast to residential buildings, the stock of non-residential buildings (NRB) in Germany is not fully represented in any official statistics. This is surprising given the economic importance of this sector. Not only the increasing relevance of climate protection makes it seem reasonable and necessary to capture the scope and characteristics of this important economic sector more precisely. The gap in official statistics could be closed by a survey based on a representative sample of building footprints and unbiased extrapolations to the whole stock, a completely new approach in the German NRB stock (H\"{o}rner 2020). The goal was to provide statistically valid data on the stock for the first time. This results in an estimated number of thermally conditioned NRBs in Germany that are relevant under the Building Energy Act (BEA) of  BEA =1.981 \pm{} 0.152 million, considerably less in number but bigger in size than previous estimates (BMWi 2020 S. 30). To map the characteristics of the building stock in an appropriate manner, a NRB typology was developed, comprising mean values of U-values, building component areas etc. and absolute frequencies of NRBs. The most important feature of the type definition is the concept of "synthetic average build-ings", whose values are unbiased extrapolations from the sample to the whole stock. They are "mean estimators" in terms of estimation theory. The areas of the components of the building envelopes (e.g. facades, roofs and floor slabs) were determined from geospatial data of the sample buildings. The survey provided additional geometric values like window area fractions and roof types as well as further monitoring variables such as insulation thicknesses and the current equipment with technical systems. The great diversity of NRBs and their values were summarized in 33 types differentiated according to 11 building functions and 3 building age bands. Model input variables for building energy simulations (e.g. U-values of building components and energy expenditure factors of the heat generators) were derived from monitoring variables of the survey and age-specific properties, similar to the TABULA project for residential buildings (Loga et al. 2012). Typologies are used to calculate the energy demand of building stocks with reasonable effort, in order to evaluate the impact of climate protection policies and to take the building stock into account adequately in scenarios. In addition, more sophisticated building stock models can be validated. So far, the current stock of non-residential buildings in Germany was mapped to a typology. Future analysis will add structural measures for energy-related modernization and calculations of the energy demand.},

	abstract     = {Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHP) are gaining interest for many applications and a very difficult task is to look at their affordability in urban environments with limited spaces. For this reason, the EU project GEO4CIVHIC has been funded. In order to set up different cases with different levels of retrofit and try to generalize results, the project focuses the activity on archetypes, i.e. buildings which may represent the usual type of building which may be found more frequently in urban environments around Europe. The analysis of the archetypes has been based on literature review and analysing the existing databases of buildings in Europe. The work allowed to determine a reference building for single family house and a building representing an apartment block for multi-users. In this latest case two types of possible uses have been examined: residential building and office building. In order to set up different levels of retrofit and cost-effective solutions, three different climates have been defined: warm climate, mild climate and cold climate. The climatic conditions do not only affect the energy demand of the building and the peak power needed for heating and cooling, but also determine different ways of buildings' construction and define different levels of insulation. Last but not least, the buildings have been also subdivided into existing buildings, i.e. built up from 1960 to 2000 and historic buildings, i.e. buildings earlier than 1960. The paper presents the first step of the research which permitted to define the different archetypes, their dimensions and way they are constructed. Moreover, the different simulations allowed to define the energy needs of the buildings as well as the peak power for heating and cooling. This allows to create a matrix for the different levels of retrofit solutions which will be associated to related costs for a cost-benefit analysis to check the most achievable solutions.},

	abstract     = {Purpose A large proportion of the environmental impacts of a technology is determined by decisions made at the early development stages. Therefore, effective approaches to grasp the potential environmental performance of a technology early in development are needed. This paper reflects on the usefulness of ex ante application of LCA using a case study on the appraisal of the potential environmental impacts of a lab-scale novel process for bioleaching of e-waste for metal recovery. Methods The LCA framework was applied at an early stage to the novel bioleaching process to embed it in a life cycle context , linking it to upstream and downstream flows. Then, a short-term future scaled-up scenario was defined using a proxy technology and estimated data. Environmental hotspots of this scenario were identified, and its environmental impacts were compared with those of a current industrial pyrometal-lurgical technique, involving an integrated smelter refinery. Results and discussion LCA displays potential environmental hotspots related to energy and material inputs for the bioleaching process and solvents for copper recovery, despite uncertainties. Comparison with an existing integrated smelter refinery technology returned an inferior environmental performance. These results could not be considered accurate given the early-stage application, yet they served as valuable preliminary information. The uncertainties also prompted further enquiry about the chosen product system boundary, the role of the emerging technology and the comparability of the technologies. Conclusions The ex ante application of life cycle assessment on an emerging technology brings a systematic rigour and discipline to an ambiguous situation at the start of technological development. Applying the LCA framework broadens the scope of the research, introducing a systems approach and long-term view. Environmental aspects and alternative perspectives on the novel technology are also brought into the research domain. The approach creates new knowledge on the novel technology's potential development, and developmental challenges are given definition at an early stage. The LCA outcomes should not be regarded as a final result but have a signalling purpose as a contribution to technological development. Though imprecise with much conjecture involved, such an approach gives a valid mock-up of a plausible future providing useful provisional insights to be built upon. Applying ex ante LCA and an exploratory scenario to an emerging technology is of great service as a developmental design tool and can be further refined in later development stages.},

In the policy arena, this becomes problematic when practitioners want to live-test various alternatives in a responsive and web-based platform. In research, computational times come into play when analyzing large systems with multiple interventions or when requiring many runs for, for example, Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate how the computational time of a number of commonly used industrial ecology tools can be reduced significantly, potentially by multiple orders of magnitude. Our case study was the optimization of scenario calculations in Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis (EEIOA). Instead of recalculating the Leontief inverse after individual changes to the interindustry relations, as is done traditionally in EEIOA scenario analysis, we give formulations to find the total value of the change in the environmental indicators in one calculation step. We illustrate these novel formulations both for a simple hypothetical system and for the full EXIOBASE EEIO model. The use of explicit formulas decreases the computational time to the degree that it becomes possible to carry out these analyses in live or web-based environments. For our case study, we find an improvement of up to four orders of magnitude.},

	abstract     = {Globally the building sector accounts for a significant portion of the overall energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions of any country. The most common approach for the collection of modeling and benchmarking data that can be used for predictions of energy performance at a national or urban scale is through classification of the building stock into representative archetypes. Developing such building archetypes is a complex task due to the difficulties associated with gathering detailed geometric and non-geometric data at an urban scale. Although existing databases and projects provide a valuable overview of a building stock, the information about buildings' physical descriptions are not regularly updated. Moreover, these databases cover only the national top-level archetypes and lack crucial information related to city or district scale building stocks. The use of national scale archetypes requires many assumptions that may not hold true for energy modeling at urban or district scale. This paper proposes a multi-scale (national, city, county and district) archetype development methodology using different data-driven approaches. The methodology consists of following five steps: 1) data collection, 2) segmentation, 3) characterization, 4) quantification, and 5) modeling results. We developed a test case based on the available building stock data of Ireland. The test case used previously developed archetype geometries coupled with the parameters determined by the characterization process to calculate annual energy use (kWh) of buildings at a multiple-scales. The resulting archetypes at national, city, county and district scale are analyzed and compared against one another. The results indicate that significant differences occur in terms of energy modeling results when national scale archetypes are used to simulate the energy performance of buildings at the local scale. These multi-scale building archetypes will aid local authorities and city planners when analyzing energy efficiency and consequently, help to improve sustainable energy policy decisions.},

However, in-depth knowledge of the magnitude and fate of such metals entering ELV recycling is lacking. This paper quantifies input of 25 scarce metals to Swedish ELV recycling, and estimates the extent to which they are recycled to material streams where their metal properties are utilised, i.e. are functionally recycled. Methodologically, scarce metals are mapped to main types of applications within newly produced Swedish car models and subsequently, material flow analysis of ELV waste streams is used as basis for identifying pathways of these applications and assessing whether contained metals are functionally recycled. Results indicate that, of the scarce metals, only platinum may be functionally recycled in its main application. Cobalt, gold, manganese, molybdenum, palladium, rhodium and silver may be functionally recycled depending on application and pathways taken. For remaining 17 metals, functional recycling is absent. Consequently, despite high overall ELV recycling rates of materials in general, there is considerable risk of losing ELV scarce metals to carrier metals, construction materials, backfilling materials and landfills. Given differences in the application of metals and identified pathways, prospects for increasing functional recycling are discussed.},

	abstract     = {Building stocks represent an extensive reservoir of secondary resources. However, common bottom-up characterization of these, often based on archetypal classification of buildings and their corresponding material intensity, are still not suitable to adequately inform circular economic strategies. Indeed, these approaches typically result in a loss of building-specific details, and a building stock characterization in terms of material mass, for example, glass, rather than component, for example, window. To deliver this higher resolution of details, a scalable approach to urban stock characterization, that enables a bottom-up estimation of building stocks at the building component level, is needed. In this paper, we present a framework to automate the characterization of urban stock. By using and combining a mobile-sensing approach with computer vision, urban stocks can be captured as 3D surface maps allowing the identification and semantic classification of stock objects, components, and materials. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through a case study of a neighborhood in Sheffield, UK, by using a prototype workflow comprising a custom-made mobile-sensing platform and an existing suite of neural network models to calculate an estimate count of buildings external doors and windows. The prototype implementation of the framework achieves comparable total and building-level component counts with those achieved through manual human counts. Such automated estimation of components enables an understanding of opportunities across the circular economic hierarchies and informs stakeholders across the supply chain to better prepare for the implementation of circular strategies including building refurbishments.},

Changes towards increased recovery of resources in order to meet climate targets and for society to transition to a circular economy are important driving forces. Scenarios are important tools for planning and assessing possible future developments and policies. This paper presents a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) model for environmental assessments of scenarios and waste management policy instruments. It is unique by including almost all waste flows in a country and also allow for including waste prevention. The results show that the environmental impacts from future waste management scenarios in Sweden can differ a lot. Waste management will continue to contribute with environmental benefits, but less so in the more sustainable future scenarios, since the surrounding energy and transportation systems will be less polluting and also because less waste will be produced. Valuation results indicate that climate change, human toxicity and resource depletion are the most important environmental impact categories for the Swedish waste management system. Emissions of fossil CO2 from waste incineration will continue to be a major source of environmental impacts in these scenarios. The model is used for analyzing environmental impacts of several policy instruments including weight based collection fee, incineration tax, a resource tax and inclusion of waste in a green electricity certification system. The effect of the studied policy instruments in isolation are in most cases limited, suggesting that stronger policy instruments as well as combinations are necessary to reach policy goals as set out in for example the EU action plan on circular economy.},

In this article, we propose a definition of prospective LCA: An LCA is prospective when the (emerging) technology studied is in an early phase of development (e.g., small-scale production), but the technology is modeled at a future, more-developed phase (e.g., large-scale production). Methodological choices in prospective LCA must be adapted to reflect this goal of assessing environmental impacts of emerging technologies, which deviates from the typical goals of conventional LCA studies. The aim of the article is to provide a number of recommendations for how to conduct such prospective assessments in a relevant manner. The recommendations are based on a detailed review of selected prospective LCA case studies, mainly from the areas of nanomaterials, biomaterials, and energy technologies. We find that it is important to include technology alternatives that are relevant for the future in prospective LCA studies. Predictive scenarios and scenario ranges are two general approaches to prospective inventory modeling of both foreground and background systems. Many different data sources are available for prospective modeling of the foreground system: scientific articles; patents; expert interviews; unpublished experimental data; and process modeling. However, we caution against temporal mismatches between foreground and background systems, and recommend that foreground and background system impacts be reported separately in order to increase the usefulness of the results in other prospective studies.},

The recovery of REE from electronic waste (e-waste) could offer a more sustainable practice. Waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) are an important resource in the e-waste stream due to their content of valuable materials. However, data regarding the concentration and distribution of REE in WPCBs is very limited. The aims of this research were: (a) to analyse the chemical composition of comminuted WPCBs prior to processing (industrially pre-treated) with emphasis on REE, and (b) to determine the distribution of REE and other metals in different size fractions of the pre-treated WPCBs. The samples were supplied by commercial e-waste recycling companies, which makes them representative of the e-waste processing industry in the UK. Correlation between elemental concentrations and particle size was analysed using Spearman's rank correlation. Most REE concentrations were inversely correlated to the particle size. Concentrations of Y, La and Gd were found up to a thousand times higher in the smaller particle size compared with coarser particles. However, most of base metals including Cu, Sn, Pb and Zn did not show this trend. The present study highlights the occurrence of REE in comminuted WPCBs, and fine fractions as potential sources of these critical elements, currently not recovered during recycling process. A cost-effective sieving step is proposed to enrich the REE content for further recovery, prevent the possible loss of REE and maximize the total material recovered from WPCBs.},

Energy systems, telecommunications, disaster management, the internet-of-things, health care, and marketing are a few of the many applications that require building information. The essential variables that most of these models require are building type, house type, area of living space, and number of residents. In order to acquire some of this information, this paper introduces a methodology and generates corresponding data. The study was conducted for specific applications in energy system modeling. Nonetheless, these data can also be used in other applications. Building locations and some of their details are openly available in the form of map data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). However, data regarding building types (i.e., residential, industrial, office, single-family house, multi-family house, etc.) are only partially available in the OSM dataset. Therefore, a machine learning classification algorithm for predicting the building types on the basis of the OSM buildings' data was introduced. Although the OSM dataset is the fundamental and most crucial one used for modeling, the machine learning algorithm's training was performed on a dataset that was prepared by combining several features from three other datasets. The generated dataset consists of approx-imately 29 million buildings, of which about 19 million are residential, with 72\% being single-family houses and the rest multi-family ones that include two-family houses and apartment buildings. Furthermore, the results were validated through a comparison with publicly available statistical data. The comparison of the resulting data with official statistics reveals that there is a percentage error of 3.64\% for residential buildings, 13.14\% for single-family houses, and -15.38\% for multi-family houses classification. Nevertheless, by incorporating the building types, this dataset is able to complement existing building information in studies in which building type information is cru-cial.},

The model is developed based on selected industry knowledge, expectations, and perceptions elicited through a participatory systems mapping session with 82 participants and 20 in-depth interviews with experts from industry, academia, and the public policy sector. Using the model, we simulate the expected ranges of resource- and economic potential. The simulation results indicate an expected commercial resource base of 1.8 to 3 million tons of copper, zinc, and cobalt, in which copper makes out the most significant part. Relating to the expected commercial resource base, we highlight a discrepancy between academic and industrial expectations, in which the academic expectations are more conservative than the industrial expectations. The corresponding net present values lie in the range of a net present loss of 970 million USD up to a net present gain of 2.53 billion USD, in which the academic expectations are projected to yield a negative net present value, while the industrial expectations are projected to yield a positive net present value. Closer investigation of the results reveals that one of the main challenges regarding SMS exploration and extraction is the initial exploration costs associated with coring operations. These costs are expected to be high with today's exploration technology. Moreover, they occur relatively early in time compared to revenue-generating activity, which has a significant negative impact on the net present value of the industry due to discounting. Thus, a key focus of the industry should be to find ways to reduce the costs associated with coring operations and/or the time it takes from initial exploration to extraction and generation of revenue.},

Methods that quantify flows of compound and minor element mixtures, rather than non-mixed elemental flows, are needed to prospectively analyze and predict inventory and performance for complex technology life cycles. This study utilizes process simulation to resolve the mass and energy balances needed to rigorously analyze these complexities in circular systems. Using physics-based prospective inventory data, we simultaneously assess the environmental and techno-economic performance of three photovoltaic life cycles and predict the effects of circularity on resource efficiency, carbon footprint, and levelized cost of electricity. One inventory dataset is generated per life cycle to ensure alignment between assessments and to identify trade-offs between environmental and techno-economic performance with respect to circularity, so linking circularity and sustainability. The linked material and energy resource and techno-economic models allow for the impacts of carbon taxation and the moderating effects of circularity to be explored. In addition to the clear environmental benefits of increased circularity, we find that it could dampen the cost impact of taxation. While confirming that perovskite-based modules, single junction or in tandem with silicon, clearly outperform the silicon market standard both techno-economically and environmentally, we show that maximum circularity does not automatically deliver the most sustainable outcome. The approach enables assessment of the combined impacts of specific technological, commercial, and policy choices made by different actors along the photovoltaic value chain.

This study proposes a novel approach that systematically changes the background processes in a prospective LCA based on scenarios of an integrated assessment model (IAM), the IMAGE model. Consistent worldwide scenarios from IMAGE are evaluated in the life cycle inventory using ecoinvent v3.3. To test the approach, only the electricity sector was changed in a prospective LCA of an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and an electric vehicle (EV) using six baseline and mitigation climate scenarios until 2050. This case study shows that changes in the electricity background can be very important for the environmental impacts of EV. Also, the approach demonstrates that the relative environmental performance of EV and ICEV over time is more complex and multifaceted than previously assumed. Uncertainty due to future developments manifests in different impacts depending on the product (EV or ICEV), the impact category, and the scenario and year considered. More robust prospective LCAs can be achieved, particularly for emerging technologies, by expanding this approach to other economic sectors beyond electricity background changes and mobility applications as well as by including uncertainty and changes in foreground parameters. A more systematic and structured composition of future inventory databases driven by IAM scenarios helps to acknowledge epistemological uncertainty and to increase the temporal consistency of foreground and background systems in LCAs of emerging technologies.},

PS indeed allows for analysis of a process with the help of mathematical models, and its ability to calculate rapidly and at little cost the mass and energy balances of processes can be exploited in the EEA of dairy processes. This paper presents the prototype of a workable tool developed to carry-out EEA of dairy processes. A process modelling and simulation software dedicated to dairy processing was developed to perform inventories of material and energy flows (IMEF) on the processes modelled by the software user. Addition of impact analysis data sets allowed for quantification of the potential environmental impacts associated with the modelled processes. Inputting economic data then made it possible to calculate the economic value associated with the modelled processes. Gathering these methods within a single numerical tool enabled EEA of any process modelled by the software user, but also identification of the hot spots and the opportunities for eco-efficiency improvements, comparisons of several scenarios of raw milk valuation, and assessment of their economic viability. In order to present the operational aspect of the developed prototype, it was used to compare the EE of fluid milk processing in Canada (Quebec) and the United-States of America. Individual eco-efficiency indicators (EEI) results showed that the potential environmental impacts were higher for the American scenario in three damage categories out of four. Economic viability results showed a slight advantage for the American scenario. Considering all the EEI, the comparative EEA did not offer evidence of a general benefit of one scenario over the other.},

As a result, various typologies of building stocks have been developed. These typologies provide engineers and architects with rough descriptions for classifying buildings into certain periods and construction types. However, real-world applications lack objective decision-making, as these classifications are usually conducted by manual investigations of buildings. To overcome this subjective approach and to ensure the reproducibility of data acquisition, this paper proposes an image-based classification using Deep Learning (DL) methods. We present the acquisition of ground truth and describe the training and testing routines on a dataset of 5,307 images obtained in the city of Weimar (located in the Free State of Thuringia, Germany), a mid-sized city representative of eastern Germany. All building images are linked to an existing building typology, allowing a classification of buildings in ten predefined and acknowledged periods. These periods are ranging from pre-1859 to post-2002. As a benchmark, an expert human baseline is acquired, showing a lower prediction accuracy than the results obtained by DL methods. Our results highlight the potential for automation in image analysis and beneficial impacts for Building Energy Modeling (BEM) on urban scale. Thus, a trustworthy data acquisition regarding the building age holds benefits for various stakeholders in BEM (engineers, architects, policymakers as well as customers).},

	abstract     = {Accounting for technological changes and innovation is important when assessing the implications of rapidly-developing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation technologies. Technological learning curves have been commonly used as a tool to understand technological change as a function of cumulative production. Traditional learning curve approaches, however, do not distinguish the direct and upstream, supply chain technological changes by which cost reductions are achieved. While recent advances in learning curves have focused on distinguishing the different physical and economic drivers of learning, forecasted technological changes have not been applied to estimate the potential changes in the environmental performance of a technology. This article illustrates how distinguishing the different effects of technological learning throughout the supply chain can help assess the changing costs, environmental impacts and natural resource implications of technologies as they develop. We propose a mathematical framework to distinguish the effects of learning on the direct inputs to a technology from the effects of learning on value added, and we incorporate those effects throughout the supply chain of a technology using a life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. An example for cadmium telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics (PV) illustrates how the proposed framework can be implemented. Results show that that life cycle GHG emissions can decrease at least 40\% and costs can decrease at least 50\% as cumulative production of CdTe reaches 100 GW. Technological learning in supply chain processes can further reduce emissions and costs by up to 1-2\%. Lastly, we discuss the implications of using this new technological learning framework in the long-term assessment of the costs, environmental impacts and resource requirements of technologies using life-cycle assessment.},

A methodology is developed to identify the flows of materials resulting from the deconstructions of buildings. The volume of demolished buildings for each typology (individual house, apartment building, office building...) and constructive system (brick, concrete, wood...) is known from the state of the art. Moreover, the quantities of demolished materials are estimated for each building typology from a French database of building waste diagnosis. Then, the volume of waste can be calculated for all the building sector and the deconstruction flows can be crossed with an analysis of the existing types of recovery (projects of close development, recycling channels, ...). This analysis will present the distribution of the different ways of recovery for each type of material and the associated costs. This capitalization of data on waste flows and building resources will allow to question the adequacy between material needs and available resources.},

It is the first application of the WILCI tool, dedicated to the LCA of MSW incineration in the French situation (Beylot et al., 2017). The model is primarily based on operational data relative to 90 plants, representing 73\% of the total mass of MSW annually incinerated in France. Regarding seven impact categories out of the nine under study, incineration of MSW in France provides a benefit (that is, a ''negative" impact). The uncertainty analysis confirms the relatively large degree of confidence of this conclusion regarding acidification and particulate matter, but in the meantime highlights the remaining uncertainty regarding most other impact categories. Energy recovery is responsible for the main share of the total environmental impacts and benefits of MSW incineration in France. Moreover, this study confirms the importance of technology differentiation in the LCA of MSW incineration. The predominance, in the French incineration sector, of energy recovery as CHP, and of SCR for NOx abatement, results in the global environmental benefits calculated per tonne of average MSW incinerated. Finally, this study addresses the contribution of each waste fraction to the total impacts and benefits of MSW incineration. It identifies several fractions whose contributions to impacts and benefits are not in line with their share in the composition of MSW incinerated.},

	abstract     = {Increasing demand for significant volumes of construction materials, especially sand for use in concrete, in rapidly developing urban environments is becoming a significant socio-economic and environmental issue. The consumption of concrete (comprised of sand, aggregates and cement) is especially concerning on a city level as vast volumes of materials are extracted within the urban hinterland, causing direct impacts locally and the potential for supply issues directly impacting city level metabolism. Excessive consumption and poor management of these materials make it increasingly hard for society to ensure new urban development and infrastructure projects, essential for maintaining the health of cities, meet sustainable development objectives. However, it is difficult to implement suitable resource management policies without first understanding how materials are produced and consumed at an appropriate spatial level. For many areas, especially on a city level, such data is absent, especially so for sand and aggregates which can further exacerbate these local supply issues and environmental impacts. This study attempts to address this data gap via combining earth observation datasets with estimates of materials contained within urban infrastructure (material intensities) to calculate the rapid increase of construction material stocks in Hanoi. Spatial data on buildings have been gathered using, producing, and collating a variety of spaceborne open-source datasets on built up areas (GlobalMLBuildingFootpint, World Settlement Footprint 3D, Open Street Map) and land use classification maps. Linking this spatial data with estimated quantities of sand, gravel, cement and concrete in typical buildings in Hanoi enables quantification of building stocks for a range of building types over a time series. The results show that for every new km2 of urban infrastructure approximately 520,000 tonnes of concrete, or 360,000 tonnes of sand, 580,000 tonnes of gravel and 115,000 tonnes of cement are required. If the Hanoi Masterplan is to be achieved by 2030, then the material demand is likely to be for 106 million tonnes of concrete or 73 million tonnes of sand, 118 million tonnes of gravel and 24 million tonnes of cement. These all exceed historical consumption trends and are far in excess of current extraction rates and therefore careful planning is required to ensure access to sustainable resources into the future.},

The combination of the two methods involves practical and conceptual challenges, but formal guidance and consensus on a rigorous approach are currently missing. This study provides a comprehensive overview of how different topic areas use future scenarios and LCA in order to identify useful methods and approaches, and to provide overall recommendations. This study carried out a systematic literature review that involved searching for peer-reviewed articles on Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct, utilising a rigorous set of keywords for future scenarios and for LCA. We identified 514 suitable peer-reviewed articles that were systematically analysed according to pre-defined sets of characteristics for the combined modelling of future scenarios and LCA. The numbers of studies combining future scenarios and LCA increase every year and in all of the 15 topic areas identified. This combination is highly complex, due to different sequences in the modelling between future scenarios and LCA, the use of additional models and topic area-specific challenges. We identify and classify studies according to three archetypal modelling sequences: input, output and hybrid. More than 100 studies provide methods and approaches for combining future scenarios and LCA, but existing recommendations are specific to topic areas and for modelling sequences, and consensus is still missing. The efficacy of many studies is hampered by lack of quality. Only half of the articles complied with the LCA ISO standards, and only one quarter demonstrated consistent knowledge of future scenario theory. We observed inconsistent use of terminology and a considerable lack of clarity in the descriptions of methodological choices, assumptions and time frames. The combined use of future scenarios and LCA requires formal guidance, in order to increase clarity and communicability. Guidance should provide unambiguous definitions, identify minimum quality requirements and produce mandatory descriptions of modelling choices. The goal and scope of future scenarios and LCA should be in accordance, and quality should be ensured both for the future scenarios and the LCA. In particular, future scenarios should always be developed contextually, to ensure effective assessment of the problem at hand. Guidance should also allow for maintaining current modelling complexity and topic area differences. We provide recommendations from the reference literature on terminology, future scenario development and the combined use of future scenarios and LCA that may already constitute preliminary guidance in the field. Information collected and recommendations provided will assist in a more balanced development of the combined use of future scenarios and LCA in view of the urgent challenges of sustainable development.},

	abstract     = {A key source of uncertainty in the environmental assessment of emerging technologies is the unpredictable manufacturing, use, and end-of-life pathways a technology can take as it progresses from lab to industrial scale. This uncertainty has sometimes been addressed in life cycle assessment (LCA) by performing scenario analysis. However, the scenario-based approach can be misleading if the probabilities of occurrence of each scenario are not incorporated. It also brings about a practical problem; considering all possible pathways, the number of scenarios can quickly become unmanageable. We present a modelling approach in which all possible pathways are modelled as a single product system with uncertain processes. These processes may or may not be selected once the technology reaches industrial scale according to given probabilities. An uncertainty analysis of such a system provides a single probability distribution for each impact score. This distribution accounts for uncertainty about the product system's final configuration along with other sources of uncertainty. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis can identify whether the future selection of certain pathways over others will be of importance for the variance of the impact score. We illustrate the method with a case study of an emerging technology for front-side metallization of photovoltaic cells.},

	abstract     = {Futures studies consist of a vast variation of studies and approaches. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of for what purposes scenarios are useful and what methods and procedures are useful for furthering these purposes. We present a scenario typology with an aim to better suit the context in which the scenarios are used. The scenario typology is combined with a new way of looking at scenario techniques, i.e. practical methods and procedures for scenario development. Finally, we look at the usefulness of scenarios in the light of the scenario typology and the scenario techniques. As a start, we distinguish between three main categories of scenario studies. The classification is based on the principal questions we believe a user may want to pose about the future. The resolution is then increased by letting each category contain two different scenario types. These are distinguished by different angles of approach of the questions defining the categories. The first question, What will happen?, is responded to by Predictive scenarios. In fact, the response to a question like this will always be conditional, e.g. of a stable and peaceful world, or by a certain continuous development of some kind. We have utilized this fact when defining the two predictive scenario types, Forecasts and What-if scenarios. The second question, What can happen?, is responded to by Explorative scenarios. The scenarios are thus explorations of what might happen in the future, regardless of beliefs of what is likely to happen or opinions of what is desirable. This category is further divided into external and strategic scenarios. The final question, How can a specific target be reached?, is responded to by Normative scenarios. Such studies are explicitly normative, since they take a target as a starting point. They are often directed towards how the target could be reached. This category is divided into preserving and transforming scenarios. If the user wants to predict the future, forecasts and what-if scenarios are of interest. If the user wants to think in terms of several possible futures, perhaps in order to be able to adapt to several different types of outcomes, explorative scenarios may be useful. If the user wants to search for scenarios fulfilling specific targets, and maybe link this to actions that can be taken towards the visions, normative scenarios should be the choice. Those three approaches to scenario studies are different. By emphasising the user's perspective to scenario studies, we have argued that the choice of scenario category is not only a question of the character of the studied system. Instead, the user's world view, perceptions and aim with the study can be even more important for the choice of approach.},

The downstream processing of the fermentation broth is a particular challenge since the broth has a highly complex composition and low concentrations of the target products. In this study, the proof-of-principle for a separation cascade for caproic (C6) and caprylic acid (C8) produced in a maize silage-based fermentation process was demonstrated. For clarification of the fermentation broth, a filter press and a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane was used to remove coarse solids and to separate suspended particles and macromolecules from the fermentation broth, respectively. With both techniques, the dry matter content was reduced from 6.8 to 2.3\% and a particle-free product solution was obtained. Subsequently, the carboxylic acids were extracted with oleyl alcohol by liquid-liquid extraction with an extraction efficiency of 85\% for C6 and 97\% for C8. Over the whole cascade, 58\% of caproic acid and 66\% of caprylic acid were recovered from the fermentation broth into the extract. Among all separation steps, solid-liquid separation with the filter press caused the major part of the product loss of 21\% of each carboxylic acid. By using separation equipment with a better solid separation efficiency such as decanter centrifuges or belt filter presses this loss could be minimized.},

Uniquely, this study provides detailed geographically explicit data on the cobalt supply chain, with the aim of both determining how susceptible primary cobalt production is to supply chain disruptions, and to evaluate possible supply risks. We conclude that the risks for supply chain disruptions are high. Firstly, the cobalt market is highly concentrated, with more than half of the cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and almost half of the cobalt refined in China. Secondly, almost all cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper and nickel. Finally, political stability in production countries is considered to be medium to very weak. There are also several factors in play that reduce supply risks. The concentration of the individual mines, refineries and companies remains under the threshold of a concentrated market, and the estimated 80 artisanal cobalt mines further diversify the mined supply. A network analysis shows the important position of companies with high betweenness and degree centrality. A disruption at these companies can affect the functioning of the overall supply chain. The geographic and a network visualization provide useful insights in the supply risks. Based on the analysis, we recommend to diversify cobalt production, through the development of mines, refineries, and efforts to ensure socially and environmentally sustainable artisanal mining.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: In a world where the population is expected to peak at around 9 billion people in the next 30 to 40~years, carefully managing our finite natural resources is becoming critical. We must abandon the outdated `take, make, consume and dispose' mentality and move toward a circular economy model for optimal resource efficiency. Products must be designed for reuse and remanufacturing, which would reduce significant costs in terms of energy and natural resources. Methods: To measure progress in achieving a circular economy, we need a life cycle approach that measures the social, economic and environmental impact of a product throughout its full life cycle--from raw material extraction to end-of-life (EoL) recycling or disposal. Life cycle thinking must become a key requirement for all manufacturing decisions, ensuring that the most appropriate material is chosen for the specific application, considering all aspects of a products' life. The steel industry has been developing LCI data for 20~years. This is used to assess a product's environmental performance from steel production to steel recycling at end-of-life. The steel industry has developed a methodology to show the benefits of using recycled steel to make new products. Using recycled materials also carries an embodied burden that should be considered when undertaking a full LCA. Results and discussion: The recycling methodology is in accordance with ISO 14040/44:2006 and considers the environmental burden of using steel scrap and the benefit of scrap recycling from end-of-life products. It considers the recycling of scrap into new steel as closed material loop recycling, and thus, recycling steel scrap avoids the production of primary steel. The methodology developed shows that for every 1~kg of steel scrap that is recycled at the end of the products life, a saving of 1.5~kg CO2-e emissions, 13.4~MJ primary energy and 1.4~kg iron ore can be achieved. This equates to 73, 64 and 90~\%, respectively, when compared to 100~\% primary production. Conclusions: Incorporating this recycling methodology into a full LCA demonstrates how the steel industry is an integral part of the circular economy model which promotes zero waste; a reduction in the amount of materials used and encourages the reuse and recycling of materials.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: To accomplish the national and international climate goals, building renovation and optimisation of their energy and resource efficiency are essential. Thus, reliable information on the building stock (BS) is necessary. Most previous building typologies are focussing on residential buildings and the operational phase. This paper shows the development of a methodology for generating non-residential building (NRB) typologies for life cycle inventory analysis (LCI) of building constructions. Hereby, archetypes of office, administration and department (OAD) buildings are developed, exemplarily for the German NRB stock. The methodology can further be utilised for quantity surveying of urban material stocks, related recycling scenarios and waste management. Furthermore, the exemplarily generated archetypes provide necessary information for the estimation of realistic refurbishment scenarios. Methods: Approaches for the development of NRB archetypes, the descriptions of associated building materials and the LCI of BS were analysed and integrated into a methodology. It provides a clear path on the classification in building usage categories and determination of relevant building parameters for conducting LCI studies. Its aim is the creation of NRB typologies, presenting construction materials and building geometry in a useful way for life-cycle assessments (LCA). To demonstrate the methodology's usability, it is applied to a case study with the sample of 161 OAD buildings, provided by the German NRB database ENOB:dataNWG. In combination with relevant literature on BS archetypes and materials, a sample OAD building typology has been created. Results and discussion: Minimum data requirements for conducting simplified LCI calculation of BSs were identified by analysing existing LCA methods, like the German BNB system. Important clusters for developing NRB archetypes were determined: building usage category, building construction types and building age. These data gaps between required information for simplified LCA studies and available information in ENOB:dataNWG were identified, and solutions for closing these data gaps were proposed and tested. Since building archetypes must reflect the overall BS, uncertainties were discussed. The ENOB:dataNWG database was not completed at the time this paper was written, so comprehensive uncertainty analyses are important next steps. Conclusions: This methodology development forms the groundwork for creating LCI building typologies for simplified LCA studies. It shows practically how to deal with a BS database and illustrates which typical values can be chosen for closing data gaps. The methodology was tested on an exemplary sample of OAD buildings. Based on this case study, the methodology concept was proven useful for the generation of a NRB typology.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: The cradle-to-gate water scarcity footprint (WSFP) of primary aluminium has been determined for global aluminium including China (GLO) and global aluminium excluding China (RoW). It consists of the following:the direct WSFP, based on the freshwater consumption data collected by the IAI from global bauxite mines, alumina refiners and aluminium smelters and the local water scarcity index (WSI) of each plant, andthe indirect WSFP which has been calculated using data collected by thinkstep on the freshwater consumption of the different ancillary materials, of the fuel and of the electricity needed for the production of alumina and aluminium and the relevant water scarcity indexes. Methods: The calculation of the direct WSFP follows the requirement of ISO 14046 to aggregate data of sites at locations with different water scarcity after multiplication with the local water scarcity index. For the indirect WSFP, regional averages of the water consumption and water scarcity index were used for an initial screening study to determine fields for further investigation. Results of this study demonstrate that data on evaporation of water from reservoirs of hydropower plants has an extremely high contribution to the indirect WSFP of primary aluminium (79~\% of the GLO value and 92~\% of the RoW value). Therefore, a plant-by-plant approach was applied for hydropower which considers the net freshwater consumption of the hydropower reservoirs and uses the local water scarcity index of each power station, individually, for the calculation of the generic WSFP of the country or region. A special treatment has been given to some multipurpose reservoirs which typically have a beneficial effect on water scarcity, i.e. they have a negative WSFP if seasonal water scarcity indices are used. Results and discussion: With this approach, the WSFP of primary aluminium has been calculated as follows:18.2~m3 H2Oe./tonne for global primary aluminium (GLO);9.6~m3 H2Oe/tonne for global primary aluminium, excluding China (RoW). Conclusions: In order to avoid distorted results of water footprint studies, in depth analysis of identified hotspots in water consumption is necessary, in this case the plant-by plant approach, in accordance with ISO 14046. Data providers are encouraged to facilitate such analysis by improving the accessibility of such detailed data.},

This framework includes the entire technology life cycle, from the early design phase up to continuous improvements of mature technologies, including their market penetration. The compatibility with commonly applied system models yields an additional aspect of the framework. Practical methods and procedures are categorised, based on how they incorporate future-oriented features in LCA. The results indicate that most of the ex-ante LCAs focus on emerging technologies that have already gone through some research cycles within narrowly defined system boundaries. There is a lack of attention given to technologies that are at a very early development stage, when all options are still open and can be explored at a low cost. It is also acknowledged that technological learning impacts the financial and environmental performance of mature production systems. Once technologies are entering the market, shifts in market composition can lead to substantial changes in environmental performance.},

Included in the study are 508 heat pumps and furnaces with differences in power over three orders of magnitude per product group. The key properties of the heat pump system were defined as mass, refrigerant use, and coefficient of performance. For the biomass furnaces, the key properties analyzed were mass, electrical input, and efficiency. The results indicated that both the mass and the refrigerant use increased subproportionally to power. For coefficient of performance and furnace efficiency, no scaling effect was found. Subproportional growth was found between two environmental impacts (global warming and ozone depletion) and power for the production phase. This scaling behavior was similar to conventional cost scaling.

	abstract     = {Purpose: A set of comparative life cycle assessment case studies were undertaken to explore key issues relating to the environmental impacts of building materials. The case studies explore modeling practice for long-life components by investigating (1) recycled content and end-of-life recycling scenarios and (2) service life and maintenance scenarios. The study uses a window unit frames as the object of comparison, allowing for exploration of multiple materials and assembly techniques. Methods: Four window frame types were compared: aluminum, wood, aluminum-clad wood, and unplasticized PVC (PVCu). These used existing product life cycle inventory data which included primary frame material, coatings, weather stripping sealants, but not glazing. The functional unit was a window frame required to produce 1~m2 of visible glazing, with similar thermal performance over a building lifespan of 80~years. The frames were compared using both the end-of-life and recycled content methods for end-of-life scenarios. The models were also tested using custom-use scenarios. Results and discussion: Well-maintained aluminum window frames proved to be the least impactful option across all categories, in large part due to the credits delivered from recycling and expectations of long-life. Wood window frames had the least variability associated with maintenance and durability. The global warming potential (GWP) of a moderately maintained aluminum assembly was found to be 68~\% less than PVCu and 50~\% less than aluminum-clad wood. Using a long-life scenario, wood windows were found to have a 7~\% lower GWP than the long-life scenario for aluminum-clad woods. Moderately and well-maintained aluminum windows require less energy to be produced and maintained over their lifetime than any of the wood scenarios. Expectations of service life proved to be the most important factor in considering environmental impact of frame materials. Conclusions: The research shows significant gaps in available data--such as average realized life expectancies of common building components--while further underscoring that recycling rates are a driving factor in the environmental impact of aluminum building products. A modeling shift from the recycled content method to the end-of-life recycling method should promote goals of material recovery over pursuit of material with high recycled content. Hybrid methods, such as the use of Module D, may bridge the divide between these two approaches by providing due credit for use of recycled material, while supporting a design for recycling ethos. Further research is needed on how design and construction decisions affect collection and recovery rates in practice.},

Prototype building models are usually developed to represent typical urban building characteristics of a specific use type, construction year, and climate zone, as detailed characteristics of individual buildings at urban scale are difficult to obtain. This study investigated the Italian building stock, developing 46 building prototypes, based on construction year, for residential and office buildings. The study included 16 single-family buildings, 16 multi-family buildings, and 14 office buildings. Building envelope properties and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system characteristics were defined according to existing building energy codes and standards for climatic zone E, which covers about half the Italian municipalities. Novel contributions of this study include (1) detailed specifications of prototype building energy models for Italian residential and office buildings that can be adopted by UBEM tools, and (2) a dataset in GeoJSON format of Italian urban buildings compiled from diverse data sources and national standards. The developed prototype building specifications, the building dataset, and the workflow can be applied to create other building prototypes and to support Italian national building energy efficiency and environmental goals.},

ECO2DES allows for maximising economic parameters such, as the net present value, and minimising environmental impacts by the integration and automation of modelling, process simulation, life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing assessment (LCC) and multi-objective optimisation algorithms (MOOA). This new methodology does not only design the optimal process from and sustainable point of view, but also reduces the workload accelerating the time-to-market of research and innovative projects in the process industry. In order to illustrate the potential of the framework, the methanation process for energy storage will be evaluated.

	abstract     = {Since the beginning of the third millennium, several trends, such as the rapid rise to global superpower status of China, with its 1.4 billion habitants; the transfer of large industrial production segments from West to East (Asia) and, more recently, of the growing political and trade tensions between the USA and China; the (re)birth of nationalisms, communitarianism and autocratic regimes; and minerals and metals industry–specific sustainability issues such as greenhouse gas emissions waste production and poor social acceptance of large-scale mining projects, are threatening the mineral and metal supplies of rich OECD countries that have depended on well-functioning free markets to supply their economies' mineral and metal needs for the past few decades. These developments happen while demography, the growth of the global middle-class, urbanisation and, now, the need for a rapid transition to low-carbon energy production all concur to a further acceleration of the global demand for minerals and metals. This context leads governments and industries to pay much more attention to potential mineral supply/pricing issues, leading to the publication of mineral criticality studies, assessing the economic importance and supply risks related to specific minerals and metals, from the point of view of specific governments, economic sectors or industries. Some criticality assessments also propose future demand scenarios for selected minerals and metals, looking at the next decades, sometimes up to 2100. While these studies provide important information on current market conditions and issues, those looking at future supply and demand appear to insufficiently consider the probability of significant technology shifts that, if confirmed, would deeply impact on future demand scenarios. Three technology shifts that appear as highly probable (Li-metal batteries (including solid-state Li batteries); low/no neodymium-, praseodymium-, dysprosium- or terbium-containing permanent magnets; and composite matrix ceramics used in aircraft jet engines and gas turbines used for electricity and heat production) are highlighting the need to better integrate technology foresight in criticality assessments as such shifts are likely to have large impacts on the demand for some of the minerals and metals that are rated as highly critical in many studies (cobalt, dysprosium, graphite, neodymium, praseodymium, rhenium and tantalum), or for which demand scenarios are presented that may outstrip possible supply.},

The results are addressed to local authorities to enable them to set up corrective actions to achieve the targets. Three realistic scenarios are investigated. The first one considers the annual current refurbishment trend and the most common energy efficiency measures. The second scenario applies the measures resulting from a cost-optimal analysis. The third scenario considers the mean annual refurbished floor area necessary to meet the climate protection targets. The results of the scenario analyses emphasise the need of implementing major refurbishments, rather than fixing stricter requirements. The building stock energy performance is assessed through the building typology approach defined in the IEE-TABULA project. It allows the models of building stock energy refurbishment to be presented in an effective way, easily understandable and manageable by non-energy experts.},

Several works have established the need of integrating the LCA and risk analysis methodologies, due to the several common aspects. One of the ways to reach such integration is through guaranteeing that uncertainties in LCA modeling are carefully treated. It has been claimed that more attention should be paid to quantifying the uncertainties present in the various phases of LCA. Though the topic has been attracting increasing attention of practitioners and experts in LCA, there is still a lack of understanding and a limited use of the available statistical tools. In this work, we introduce a protocol to conduct global sensitivity analysis in LCA. The article focuses on the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and particularly on the relevance of global techniques for the development of trustable impact assessment models. We use a novel characterization model developed for the quantification of the impacts of noise on humans as a test case. We show that global SA is fundamental to guarantee that the modeler has a complete understanding of: (i) the structure of the model and (ii) the importance of uncertain model inputs and the interaction among them.},

In most EU member states, about 70-90\% of the buildings were constructed at least 20 years ago. Due to this, these buildings have a worse energy efficiency behavior than the new ones that comply with current regulations. As a consequence, acting on the existing building stock is needed, developing special methods on assessment and advice in order to reduce the total energy consumption. This article addresses a procedure allowing the classification and characterization of existing buildings facades. It can help researchers to achieve in-depth knowledge of the facades construction and therefore knowing their thermal behavior. Once knowing that, the most appropriate upgrading strategies can be established with the purpose of reducing the energy demand. Furthermore, the classified facade typologies have been verified, complying with current and future Spanish regulations and according to the results obtained, a series of upgrading strategies based on the opaque part and those in the translucent part, have been proposed. As a conclusion, this procedure helps us to select the most appropriate improvement measures for each type of facade in order to comply with current and future Spanish regulations. This proposed method has been tested in a specific neighborhood of Madrid, in a selected period of time, between 1950 and 1980, but it could be applicable to any other city. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

National typologies are sets of model buildings with characteristic energy-related properties representative of a country's building stock. The model buildings are used as a showcase for demonstrating the energy performance and the potential energy savings from typical and advanced energy conservation measures (ECMs) on the thermal envelope and the heat supply system.

The work exploits Census and statistical data for defining the Hellenic building stock and empirical adaptation factors to make more realistic estimates from normative calculations. The analysis is supported by a detailed data disaggregation in terms of the number of dwellings and floor areas, based on envelope thermal characteristics, heat production units, energy carriers, use of renewables etc. The calculation results are adapted for the building types and then projected to the building stock. Numerous scenarios for different modernization rates are assessed for identifying the most promising refurbishment strategies in space heating and DHW for reaching the 2020 and 2030 national CO2 emission targets.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: This paper will give an overview of LCA studies on lead metal production and use recently conducted by the International Lead Association. Methods: The lead industry, through the International Lead Association (ILA), has recently completed three life cycle studies to assess the environmental impact of lead metal production and two of the products that make up approximately 90~\% of the end uses of lead, namely lead-based batteries and architectural lead sheet. Results and discussion: Lead is one of the most recycled materials in widespread use and has the highest end-of-life recycling rate of all commonly used metals. This is a result of the physical chemical properties of the metal and product design, which makes lead-based products easily identifiable and economic to collect and recycle. For example, the end-of-life collection and recycling rates of lead automotive and industrial batteries and lead sheet in Europe are 99 and 95~\%, respectively, making them one of the few products that operate in a true closed loop. These high recycling rates, coupled with the fact that both lead-based batteries and architectural lead sheet are manufactured from recycled material, have a beneficial impact on the results of LCA studies, significantly lowering the overall environmental impact of these products. This means that environmental impacts associated with mining and smelting of lead ores are minimised and in some cases avoided completely. The lead battery LCA assesses not only the production and end of life but also the use phase of these products in vehicles. The study demonstrates that the technological capabilities of innovative advanced lead batteries used in start-stop vehicles significantly offset the environmental impact of their production. A considerable offset is realised through the savings achieved in global warming potential when lead-based batteries are installed in passenger vehicles with start-stop and micro-hybrid engine systems which have significantly lower fuel consumption than regular engines. Conclusions: ILA has undertaken LCAs which investigate the environmental impact associated with the European production of lead metal and the most significant manufactured lead products (lead-based batteries used in vehicles and architectural lead sheet for construction) to ensure up-to-date and robust data is publically and widely available.},

During the last decade, the circular economy became an attractive paradigm to increase global welfare while minimizing the environmental impacts of economic activities. Although several studies concerning the potential benefits and drawbacks of policies that implement the new paradigm have been performed, there is currently no standardized theoretical model or software to execute such assessment. In order to fill this gap, in the present paper we show how to perform these analyses using Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis. We also describe a python package (pycirk) for modeling Circular Economy scenarios in the context of the Environmentally Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output database EXIOBASE V3.3, for the year 2011. We exemplify the methods and software through a what-if zero-cost case study on two circular economy strategies (Resource Efficiency and Product Lifetime Extension), four environmental pressures and two socio-economic factors.},

The work exploits data from about 2400 building energy audits that include general information as well as specific characteristics on the envelope construction and the electromechanical installations. The information were first screened by a data quality control and were then organized into 239 classes that correspond to the Hellenic nonresidential building typology, defined in terms of building use, vintage, and location. The analysis revealed that there is a great potential for upgrading the existing building stock, since only 4\% of the audited buildings meet the current minimum thermal envelope code requirements and 15\% are in compliance with code recommendations for the technical installations. Overall, only 1\% of the buildings have fully compliant envelope and technical installations. The calculated total final energy use averages 217.5kWh/m2 for the entire NR sector, ranging between 89.0kWh/m2 and 530.0kWh/m2 among the different building uses.},

	abstract     = {Local and central administrations are often called to properly allocate economic resources intended for the territorial energy planning, on the basis of the performances achieved by implementing energy conservation measures. Particularly in the residential sector, that represents one of the most relevant sector for the energy demand, effective and reliable evaluation tools are required for this aim. Unfortunately, building stocks are characterized by a very large number of buildings that are referred to different construction periods and are equipped with a variety of appliances and tools, other than with different heating and cooling systems. This means that the whole energy consumption of a large territorial context cannot be obtained by simply summing up the energy requirements of each single dwelling and building. A procedure is therefore needed that, by means of a suitable characterization of the building stock and of the structure of the energy consumption, allows to assess the whole residential energy requirements and the effects induced by energy conservation measures.To provide a contribution in this direction, a methodology is here introduced for the disaggregation of a given building stock into proper typologies that are representative of the different construction practices characterizing different periods of time. The climatic properties of sites are accounted for in this methodology as well. Furthermore, the whole energy consumption is assessed using different approaches for heating, cooling, lighting and other electric appliances. This multiple approach relies on statistical data and on the application of well established calculation tools for the energy demand of buildings. In this way "virtual" sample buildings are defined as representative of the considered building stock.The method has been applied to the entire building sector of the Sicilian Region and its reliability has been checked against real data. The found value of the overall energy demand of the residential sector is 1100. ktoe/y, while the actual value coming from official statistics was 1192. ktoe in the year 2011; this signals the fair reliability of the method.},

This article discusses six areas of debate and potential misunderstandings concerning attributional LCA. These are: 1) LCA results of all the products in the world should add up to the total environmental impact of the world, sometimes referred to as the 100 \% rule. 2) Attributional LCA is less relevant than consequential LCA. 3) System expansion, and/or substitution, cannot be used in attributional LCA. 4) Attributional LCA leads to more truncation errors than consequential LCA does. 5) There is a clear connection between the goal and questions of an LCA and the choice of attributional or consequential LCA. 6) There is a clear boundary between attributional and consequential LCA. In the article, these statements are discussed, and it is argued that they are either misunderstandings or sometimes incorrect.},

This study represents the latest contribution from zinc producers, which historically established the first life cycle inventory for primary zinc production in 1998 (Western Europe) and the first global LCA-based cradle-to-gate study for zinc concentrate and special high-grade zinc (SHG; 99.99~\%) in 2009. Improvements from the previous studies were realized through expanded geographical scope and range of production technologies. Methods: The product system under study (SHG zinc) was characterized by collecting primary data for the relevant production processes, including zinc ore mining and concentration, transportation of the zinc concentrate, and zinc concentrate smelting. This data was modeled in GaBi 6 and complemented with background data from the GaBi 2013 databases to create the cradle-to-gate LCA model. Allocation was used to distribute the inputs and outputs among the various co-products produced during the production process, with mass of metal content being the preferred allocation approach, when applicable. Results and discussion: In total, this global study includes primary data from 24 mines and 18 smelters, which cover 4.7 \texttimes{} 106~MT of zinc concentrate and 3.4 \texttimes{} 106~MT of SHG zinc, representing 36 and 27~\% of global production, respectively. While the LCA model generated a full life cycle inventory, selected impact categories and indicators are reported in this article (global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, ozone creation potential, and primary energy demand). The results show that SHG zinc has a primary energy demand of 37,500~MJ/t and a climate change impact of 2600~kg~CO2-eq./t. Across all impact categories and indicators reported here, around 65~\% of the burden are associated with smelting, 30~\% with mining and concentration, and 5~\% with transportation of the concentrate. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for the allocation method (total mass versus mass of metal content) and transportation of zinc concentrate. Conclusions: This study generated updated LCA information for the global production of SHG zinc, in line with the metal industry's current harmonization efforts. Through the provision of unit process information for zinc concentrate and SHG zinc production, greater transparency is achieved. Technological and temporal representativeness was deemed to be high. Geographical representativeness, however, was found to be moderate to low. Future studies should focus on increasing company participation from underrepresented regions.},

This is not only relevant for new buildings. Also the existing building stock represents a great amount of building materials, which could become available for reuse and recycling in the future. Currently, there is no database in Belgium that reflects the potential of existing buildings as material banks. Nevertheless, existing databases, e.g. the EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) database of the Flemish Energy Agency (VEA), contain valuable information on the material content in the existing building stock. Therefore, this paper explores the possibility of combining existing databases to reflect the (future) potential of the existing building stock as material bank. The two main databases under study are: 1) the EPC database of VEA which contains general building characteristics, such as building volume, building typology, floor area and information on the building envelope of more than 1 million buildings in the Flemish region and 2) the database of Essencia Marketing, a marketing agency specialized in the construction sector, which contains general building characteristics as well as geometrical and material data on almost 6000 new residential buildings spread all over Belgium (constructed between mid-2010 and mid-2017). The data in the databases are discussed and possible methods to combine data from both databases are explored.},

One of the main steps in evaluating potential human and economic losses in a seismic risk assessment, is the development of inventory databases for existing building stocks in terms of load-resisting structural systems and material characteristics (building typologies classification). The common approach for building stock model classification is to perform extensive fieldwork and walk-down surveys in representative areas of a city, and in some cases using random sample surveys of geounits. This procedure is time and cost consuming, and subject to personal interpretation: to mitigate these costs, we have introduced a machine learning methodology to automate this classification based on publicly available image databases. We here use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically identify the different building typologies in the city of Oslo, Norway, based on facade images taken from in-situ fieldwork and from Google Street View. We use transfer learning of state-of-the-art pretrained CNNs to predict the Model Building Typology. The present article attempts to categorize Oslo's building stock in five main building typologies: timber, unreinforced masonry, reinforced concrete, composite (steel-reinforced concrete) and steel. This method results in 89\% accuracy score for timber buildings, though only 35\% success score for steel-reinforced concrete buildings. We here classify and define for the first time a relevant set of five typologies for the Norwegian building typologies as observed in Oslo and applicable at national level. In addition, this study shows that CNNs can significantly contribute in terms of developing a cost-effective building stock model.},

In order to anticipate the life cycle environmental impacts of products under climate mitigation scenarios, we present the modeling framework of an integrated hybrid life cycle assessment model covering nine world regions. Life cycle assessment databases and multiregional input-output tables are adapted using forecasted changes in technology and resources up to 2050 under a 2 \textdegree{}C scenario. We call the result of this modeling "technology hybridized environmental-economic model with integrated scenarios" (THEMIS). As a case study, we apply THEMIS in an integrated environmental assessment of concentrating solar power. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions for this plant range from 33 to 95 g CO2 eq./kWh across different world regions in 2010, falling to 30-87 g CO2 eq./kWh in 2050. Using regional life cycle data yields insightful results. More generally, these results also highlight the need for systematic life cycle frameworks that capture the actual consequences and feedback effects of large-scale policies in the long term.},

	abstract     = {LCA is a well-known assessment tool that identifies and provides insights on the environmental impacts of products and services over their lifecycle. The guidance provided by the existing manuals typically applies to modelling and assessing environmental impacts ex-post, meaning that information is available from empirical experience after products have been commercially in use for extended periods of time. This information is not available if LCA is applied in an ex-ante manner before a technology is commercially deployed at scale. We identify the major challenges of applying LCA in an ex-ante manner and propose a route forward in dealing with these challenges that combines intuitions from other disciplinary fields. The first challenge is how to model consistent future foreground systems for the incumbent and new technology systems. Learning curves and scenario approaches are the way forward. The second challenge is how to model future background systems. Here a solution is to transform existing LCI databases towards future contexts, informed by the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that provide scenarios in line with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Finally, uncertainty in ex-ante LCA is of a different nature as in ex-post LCAs. The main difference with conventional LCA studies is the highly uncertain information for the future. To acknowledge this. considerate attention should be attributed to the discussion on these uncertainties, both in the design of the assessment and the data used. Responsive evaluation can play a supportive role here. This will increase the transparency and efficacy of the results because the relevant stakeholders and experts are involved. In this way technology designers and other stakeholders derive insights on the influence of design choices or contextual factors (that are important, but hard to influence) on the potential environmental impacts of their foreseen technology.},

However, the widespread use of LIBs has resulted in the significant accumulation of batteries with different chemistries in landfills. Existing methods for LIB recycling are unsustainable, non-environmentally friendly and ineffective at recycling spent LIBs with mixed chemistry. These methods are inadequate to achieve recovery and repurposing of the valuable and sometimes toxic components. This mandates an inherent need to improve the existing processes or develop a novel, sustainable, environmentally friendly and effective alternative process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the current recovery technologies; demonstrating the gaps in understanding, the challenges and opportunities available in the recycling processes. This review will also examine and discuss different fundamental scientific principles and methods that can be employed to develop sustainable and effective recycling processes with an aim to facilitate the LIB recycling industry to shift towards a circular economy.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: In 2001, the International Molybdenum Association (IMOA) initiated their life cycle assessment (LCA) program performing cradle-to-gate life cycle inventories (LCIs) of three molybdenum metallurgical products, followed by LCIs of eight molybdenum chemicals and an update to the metallurgical LCIs. From 2012 to 2014, IMOA participated in a multi-metal industry initiative to harmonize the methodological approach to metal-related LCAs. This paper describes some of IMOA's conclusions formed from its program and, coupled with its involvement in the multi-metal initiative, provides some lessons learned. Methods: For this paper, IMOA evaluated the benefits of its LCI program, including its ability to communicate effectively with member companies and stakeholders on the development, use, and application of life cycle data. Likewise, IMOA developed the competence to recognize and provide input on potentially inappropriate use of LCA. IMOA performed a literature review to highlight some of the scientific research using the molybdenum LCI data. IMOA also reviewed the metal industry's guidance document to provide its perspective on it, including similarities, differences, and substantiation of elements of the four topic areas. Results and discussion: The metal industry's guidance document identified four topic areas as essential for alignment with respect to metal-related LCAs: (1) system boundaries, (2) coproduct modelling, (3) life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and (4) metals recycling modelling. IMOA is largely in agreement with the approaches described in the document. The paper provides examples of how these have been applied to LCAs on Mo-bearing products as well as examples of how some LCA work can benefit from the guidance document. Conclusions: Having taken part in the harmonization effort, IMOA is poised to educate its member companies and stakeholders about some of the challenging issues encountered in LCA and will continue to lead through active industry participation. IMOA supplies its LCI data via a formal request process which enables open dialogue with stakeholders and LCA practitioners while providing IMOA with insights into how its products fit into the broader lifecycle context and facilitating stakeholders' awareness of LCA and metals.},

	abstract     = {Goal, Scope and Background. In the recently published (Dutch) Handbook on LCA, economic allocation is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA. Although the Handbook on LCA aimed to provide a 'cookbook' with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this was not completely achieved for the allocation step. The guidelines for allocation largely remained at the level of principles. This restricted elaboration of economic allocation may hamper application in practice. Therefore, this paper elaborates some examples applying economic allocation. Method. Two concepts are of particular importance when applying economic allocation: functional flow and multi-functional process. The definitions of these concepts are presented and discussed. The basic principle of economic allocation is that having determined the various functional flows of a multi-functional process, all other flows need to be allocated to these functional flows according to their shares in the total proceeds. Proceeds are based on prices and these are not always easy to determine for a process. A summary of possible solutions for different problems when determining prices is given. Results and Discussion. The examples presented focus on co-production and various recycling situations. All examples are hypothetical in order to avoid discussions on the data. The examples show that the prices of the functional flows determine the allocation results. It is of importance to have correct information on the relative prices of the functional flows at stake, especially whether they are negative or positive. Learning from these examples, we establish a decision tree for economic allocation. The decision tree is meant for identifying and handling multi-functionality situations starting from a defined (product) system. This decision tree is with minor adaptations also applicable to other allocation methods and has a more general value than for the economic allocation method only. Conclusions and perspective. The examples have helped us to establish a decision tree for handling the multi-functionality problem by economic allocation. The examples can be broadened to other materials and allocation situations. We would encourage others to provide other examples and experiences as we expect that these will help to further improve and refine the guidelines and decision tree for economic allocation in future.},

Many of the more recent developments were initiated to broaden traditional environmental LCA to a more comprehensive Life Cycle Sustainability Analysis (LCSA). Recently, a framework for LCSA was suggested linking life cycle sustainability questions to knowledge needed for addressing them, identifying available knowledge and related models, knowledge gaps, and defining research programs to fill these gaps. LCA is evolving into LCSA, which is a transdisciplinary integration framework of models rather than a model in itself. LCSA works with a plethora of disciplinary models and guides selecting the proper ones, given a specific sustainability question. Structuring, selecting, and making the plethora of disciplinary models practically available in relation to different types of life cycle sustainability questions is the main challenge. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

The ontology is based on UniFormat and MasterFormat to facilitate interoperability with existing construction management practices, and to suggest a standardized structure for future material intensity studies. The data structure supports investigation into how form and building design are driving material use, opportunities to reduce construction material consumption and better understanding of how materials are used in buildings.},

Maps of built-up surface area, building height, and building types were derived from optical Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 satellite data to map patterns of material stocks for Austria and Germany. Using material intensity factors, we calculated the mass of different types of buildings and infrastructures, distinguishing eight types of materials, at 10 m spatial resolution. The total mass of buildings and infrastructures in 2018 amounted to 5 Gt in Austria and 38 Gt in Germany (AT: 540 t/cap, DE: 450 t/cap). Cross-checks with independent data sources at various scales suggested that the method may yield more complete results than other data sources but could not rule out possible overestimations. The method yields thematic differentiations not possible with NTL, avoids the use of costly cadastral data, and is suitable for mapping larger areas and tracing trends over time.},

	abstract     = {Biogas has emerged as an alternative renewable fuel to natural gas. However, the presence of trace contaminants and large quantities of CO2 in biogas necessitates its purification and upgrading to increase its calorific value. Different technologies have been developed to upgrade biogas to biomethane. Among these, chemical absorption is commonly employed due to its high process efficiency and less solvent requirement due to high selectivity compared to physical absorption. However, the chemical decomposition of amine-based solvents, toxicological impact, high plant maintenance costs, high enthalpy of reaction, and corrosivity associated with chemical absorption limit its large-scale application. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have garnered attention as alternative absorption media to conventional solvents. ILs have a high CO2 uptake, thermal stability, and negligible vapor pressure. Recent process simulation studies featuring ILs as solvents for biogas upgrading reveal the suitability of these approaches as alternatives to laborious experimental work to assess the practical, technical, and economic viability of ILs. As per the authors' knowledge, this is the first review comparing biogas upgrading technologies from a technical, environmental, and economic perspective. Primarily, studies relating to IL-based biogas upgrading are considered, and challenges associated with the large-scale adoption of ILs as absorption media are discussed. Process simulations and techno-economic assessments of IL-based biogas upgrading techniques are presented. A conceptual design approach is proposed for the successful scale-up of IL-based biogas upgrading. Based on results, deep eutectic solvents are recommended as next-generation solvents for absorption as technical and economic aspects are found superior to conventional amines and ionic liquids.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: The past two decades have seen growing pressure on vehicle manufacturers to reduce the environmental impact of their vehicles. One effective way to improve fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emissions is to use advanced high-strength steels (AHSS) that offer equal strength and crash resistance at lower mass. The present study assesses the life cycle environmental impacts of two steel grades considered for the B-pillar in the Ford Fusion: A press-hardened boron steel design as used in the previous model of the vehicle and a hydroformed component made from a mix of the molybdenum-bearing dual phase steels DP800 and DP1000. Methods: Information related to the component masses and grades was provided by Ford. Process models for the steelmaking process, finishing, forming, vehicle use and end of life were created in the GaBi LCA software tool. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the impact of the hydroforming process for the new component, for which only proxy data were available and on the mix of DP800 and DP1000 in the B-pillar. Results have been presented for the environmental impact categories deemed most relevant to vehicle use. Results and discussion: The life cycle assessment showed that the new DP800/DP1000 B-pillar design has a lower impact for the environmental impact categories assessed. Overall, the global warming potential (GWP) of the new DP800/DP1000 design was 29~\% lower than the boron steel design over the full life cycle of the vehicle. The use phase was found to be the major source of environmental impacts, accounting for 93~\% of the life cycle GWP impact. The 4~kg weight saving accounts for the majority of the difference in impacts between the two B-pillar designs. Impacts from manufacturing were also lower for the new design for all of the impact categories assessed despite the higher alloy content of the steel. A sensitivity analysis of the hydroforming process showed that even if impacts from forming were 100~\% greater than for press hardening, the GWP from production of the new B-pillar design would still be lower than the boron steel version. Conclusions and recommendations: The molybdenum-bearing DP1000/DP800 B-pillar was found to have lower life cycle and production impacts than the previous boron steel design. The assessment indicates that significant improvements in the environmental impacts associated with the body structure of vehicles could be made through the increased use of AHSS in vehicles without compromising crash performance.},

	abstract     = {The environmental benefits of low-carbon technologies, such as photovoltaic modules, have been under debate because their large-scale deployment will require a drastic increase in metal production. This is of concern because higher metal demand may induce ore grade decline and can thereby further intensify the environmental footprint of metal supply. To account for this interlinkage known as the ``energy-resource nexus'', energy and metal supply scenarios need to be assessed in conjunction. We investigate the trends of future impacts of metal supplies and low-carbon technologies, considering both metal and electricity supply scenarios. We develop metal supply scenarios for copper, nickel, zinc, and lead, extending previous work. Our scenarios consider developments such as ore grade decline, energy-efficiency improvements, and secondary production shares. We also include two future electricity supply scenarios from the IMAGE model using a recently published methodology. Both scenarios are incorporated into the background database of ecoinvent to realize an integrated modeling approach, that is, future metal supply chains make use of future electricity and vice versa. We find that impacts of the modeled metal supplies and low-carbon technologies may decrease in the future. Key drivers for impact reductions are the electricity transition and increasing secondary production shares. Considering both metal and electricity scenarios has proven valuable because they drive impact reductions in different categories, namely human toxicity (up to -43\%) and climate change (up to -63\%), respectively. Thus, compensating for lower ore grades and reducing impacts beyond climate change requires both greener electricity and also sustainable metal supply.

	abstract     = {Many methods have been reported and used to include recycling in life cycle assessments (LCAs). This paper evaluates six widely used methods: three substitution methods (i.e. substitution based on equal quality, a correction factor, and alternative material), allocation based on the number of recycling loops, the recycled-content method, and the equal-share method. These six methods were first compared, with an assumed hypothetical 100\% recycling rate, for an aluminium can and a disposable polystyrene (PS) cup. The substitution and recycled-content method were next applied with actual rates for recycling, incineration and landfilling for both product systems in selected countries. The six methods differ in their approaches to credit recycling. The three substitution methods stimulate the recyclability of the product and assign credits for the obtained recycled material. The choice to either apply a correction factor, or to account for alternative substituted material has a considerable influence on the LCA results, and is debatable. Nevertheless, we prefer incorporating quality reduction of the recycled material by either a correction factor or an alternative substituted material over simply ignoring quality loss. The allocation-on-number-of-recycling-loops method focusses on the life expectancy of material itself, rather than on a specific separate product. The recycled-content method stimulates the use of recycled material, i.e. credits the use of recycled material in products and ignores the recyclability of the products. The equal-share method is a compromise between the substitution methods and the recycled-content method. The results for the aluminium can follow the underlying philosophies of the methods. The results for the PS cup are additionally influenced by the correction factor or credits for the alternative material accounting for the drop in PS quality, the waste treatment management (recycling rate, incineration rate, landfilling rate), and the source of avoided electricity in case of waste incineration. The results for the PS cup, which are less dominated by production of virgin material than aluminium can, furthermore depend on the environmental impact categories. This stresses the importance to consider other impact categories besides the most commonly used global warming impact. The multitude of available methods complicates the choice of an appropriate method for the LCA practitioner. New guidelines keep appearing and industries also suggest their own preferred method. Unambiguous ISO guidelines, particularly related to sensitivity analysis, would be a great step forward in making more robust LCAs.},

Half of municipal solid waste (MSW) is materially recycled and the other half thermally treated with energy recovery. A key component of an industrial ecosystem is increasing the resource efficiency through circulating materials. Recycling rates (RRs), an indicator for the circulating behavior of materials, are often used as measure for the degree of circularity of an economy. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the recycling of paper, cardboard, aluminum, tinplate, glass, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from MSW in Switzerland by splitting the RRs into closed- and open-loop collection rate (CR) and RRs. Whereas CR refers to collected material that enters the recycling process, RRs measure the available secondary resources produced from recycling processes. For PET, the closed-loop CR of 45\% and the open-loop CR of 40\% compare to an RR of 31\% and 37\%, respectively (including exports and recycling of polyethylene and metals from collection). Official collection rates for paper and cardboard are very high (97\%), whereas CR of 74\% and 89\% and RR of 59\% and 81\% for paper and cardboard, respectively, were found in the present study (including export). For a majority of the separately collected materials investigated, the rates that are determined are substantially lower than those that are officially communicated. Furthermore, given that official rates often do not provide information on the availability of secondary materials, the improvement potential for increased resource recovery is hidden.</p>},

In order to investigate impacts of materials on a building level, we present a bottom-up building stock model that uses three-dimensional and geo-referenced building data to determine volumetric information of material stocks in Swiss residential buildings. We used a probabilistic modeling approach to calculate future material flows for the individual buildings. We investigated six scenarios with different assumptions concerning per-capita floor area, building stock turnover, and construction material. The Swiss building stock will undergo important structural changes by 2035. While this will lead to a reduced number in new constructions, material flows will increase. Total material inflow decreases by almost half while outflows double. In 2055, the total amount of material in- and outflows are almost equal, which represents an important opportunity to close construction material cycles. Total environmental impacts due to production and disposal of construction material remain relatively stable over time. The cumulated impact is slightly reduced for the wood-based scenario. The scenario with more insulation material leads to slightly higher material-related emissions. An increase in per-capita floor area or material turnover will lead to a considerable increase in impacts. The new modeling approach overcomes the limitations of previous bottom-up building models and allows for investigating building material flows and stocks in space and time. This supports the development of tailored strategies to reduce the material footprint and environmental impacts of buildings and settlements.},

Design/methodology/approach: In order to: capture regional differences of urban areas; and describe individual building components of neighbourhoods, the author proposes the construction of a new building typology based upon a regional material catalog (Klau\ss{} et al. 2009a). Findings: The main findings of this analysis are primarily on method. The author presents a method to estimate the building shell from available information on the digital cadastre and the first attempt to link material databases with a ranking algorithm. The analysis application presented in this paper shows that the embodied energy on insulation materials and the corresponding energetic payback time depends on the ``real'' building shell, making it important to accurately compute this value. Practical implications: Results from this analysis present an heat demand urban model able to capture: regional differences, thanks to the use of the regional material catalog, local characteristics of the building stock, thanks to the detailed information of the digital cadastre, and ability to link building stock models with rich Live Cycle Inventory (LCI) databases for the explicit consideration of the embodied energy of retrofit measures. Further applications of the developed method could be used to assess new urban development plans of the city as well as financial incentives packages for building retrofits. Originality/value: This analysis shows the first step towards the development of a new building typology constructed upon a regional material catalog. This innovation allows taking regional differences into account. Because the author uses a detailed catalog of building components, an accounting of embodied energy by linking data of a LCI database is possible. In this paper the author presents an application of the enriched data set, the presented example shows the needed embodied energy by adding an extra layer to the predefined building components of selected buildings of the digital cadastre.},

For each building type the following outputs are calculated: the solar yield, the maximum potential energy that can be produced by roof-integrated photovoltaic panels, the maximum potential energy that can be covered by solar thermal collectors and the realistic energy produced by solar thermal collectors taking into account economical considerations.

The main problematic constituents that reduce the quality level of the recycled aggregates applications are brick components, flaky particles, and attached mortar, which make up a large proportion of CDW in some countries. This paper studies the potential of brick separation technology based on shape characteristics in order to increase the recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) purity for MRA quality improvement. MRA after purification was also processed with surface treatment experiment by rotating in a cylinder to improve the shape characteristics and to remove the attached mortar. The purity, strength property, densities, water absorption ratio, shape index, and mortar removal ratio of MRA were studied before and after the use of the brick separation and surface treatment proposed in this study. Finally, the recycled aggregates upgradation solution was adopted in a stationary recycling plant designed for a length of 113 km highway construction. The properties of CDW mixed concrete for precast curbs manufacturing were conducted. The results indicate that problematic fractions (brick components, particle shape, and surface weakness) in the MRA were significantly reduced by using brick separation and surface treatment solution. Above all, it is very important that the proposed brick separation method was verified to be practically adopted in CDW recycling plant for highway base layer construction and concrete curbs manufacturing at a low cost.},

However, material quality generally degrades during recycling because materials get contaminated or some substances dissipate. This translates to that materials are instead recycled in an open loop, or in other words, in a cascade. Current quantitative performance measurement approaches insufficiently address a clear distinction between closed-loop and open-loop recycling. To effectively preserve material quality, a different measurement approach is required to assess the ability of product and service design to retain material quality during material recycling. Such a metric is introduced here with the fitness for closed-loop material recycling indicator \ensuremath{\Theta}. This kind of quality assessment requires a criterion based on the elemental composition of the materials. The concept is illustrated in a case study on metals embodied in a residential gas heating appliance showing that the closed-loop recycling potential of such an appliance is only 1\%.},

	abstract     = {While life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool often used to evaluate the environmental impacts of products and technologies, the amount of data required to perform such studies make the evaluation of emerging technologies using the conventional LCA approach challenging. The development paradox is such that the inputs from a comprehensive environmental assessment has the greatest effect early in the development phase, and yet the data required to perform such an assessment are generally lacking until it is too late. Previous attempts to formalize strategies for performing streamlined or screening LCAs were made in the late 1990s and early 2000s, mostly to rapidly compare the environmental performance of product design candidates. These strategies lack the transparency and consistency required for the environmental screening of large numbers of early-development candidates, for which data are even sparser. We propose the Lifecycle Screening of Emerging Technologies method (LiSET). LiSET is an adaptable screening-to-LCA method that uses the available data to systematically and transparently evaluate the environmental performance of technologies at low readiness levels. Iterations follow technological development and allow a progression to a full LCA if desired. In early iterations, LiSET presents results in a matrix structure combined with a ``traffic light'' color grading system. This format inherently communicates the high uncertainty of analysis at this stage and presents numerous environmental aspects assessed. LiSET takes advantage of a decomposition analysis and data not traditionally used in LCAs to gain insight to the life cycle impacts and ensure that the most environmentally sustainable technologies are adopted.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: The majority of LCA studies begin with the drawing of a process flow diagram, which then needs to be translated manually into an LCA model. This study presents an initial image processing pipeline, implemented in an open-source software package, called lcopt-cv, which can be used to identify the boxes and links in a photograph of a hand-drawn process flow diagram and automatically create an LCA foreground model. Methods: The computer vision pipeline consists of a total of 15 steps, beginning with loading the image file and conversion to greyscale. The background is equalised, then the foreground of the image is extracted from the background using thresholding. The lines are then dilated and closed to account for drawing errors. Contours in the image are detected and simplified, and rectangles (contours with four corners) are identified from the simplified contours as `boxes'. Links between these boxes are identified using a flood-filling technique. Heuristic processing, based on knowledge of common practice in drawing of process flow diagrams, is then performed to more accurately identify the typology of the identified boxes and the direction of the links between them. Results and discussion: The performance of the image processing pipeline was tested on four flow diagrams of increasing difficulty: one simple computer drawn diagram and three photographs of hand-drawn diagrams (a simple diagram, a complex diagram and a diagram with merged lines). A set of default values for the variables which define the pipeline was developed through trial and error. For the two simple flow charts, all boxes and links were identified using the default settings. The complex diagram required minor tweaks to the default values to detect all boxes and links. An `unstacking' heuristic allowed the diagram with merged lines to be correctly processed. After some manual reclassification of link directions and process types, the diagrams were turned into LCA models and exported to open-source LCA software packages (lcopt and Brightway) to be verified and analysed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that it is possible to generate a fully functional LCA model from a picture of a flow chart. This has potentially important implications not only for LCA practitioners as a whole, but in particular for the teaching of LCA. Skipping the steep learning curve required by most LCA software packages allows teachers to focus on important LCA concepts, while participants maintain the benefits of experiential learning by doing a `real' LCA.},

By extension, we know that using today's data in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies claiming to represent future scenarios is problematic. For the future impact of products to be estimated in a consistent and meaningful manner in LCA, the background system, most commonly the ecoinvent database, needs to be projected into the future alongside the foreground system modeled in a given study. Futura is a new piece of open-source software which allows LCA practitioners to create and share novel background databases representing arbitrary scenarios. It allows users to import a base database and then start making targeted changes. These changes take three main forms--adding new technologies, regionalizing new or existing technologies, and altering market compositions. All changes made are automatically added to a "recipe." This recipe file can be shared publicly. This recipe can be imported by other users and used to exactly recreate the modified database. The additive and transparent nature of this system means that initially simple scenarios can be built upon by others to progress toward more comprehensive scenarios in a stepwise manner. The inability to build on the work of others is a serious barrier to the progress of the LCA field. Futura goes some way to reduce this barrier in the field of prospective LCA.},

	abstract     = {The sustainable future of the world challenges engineers to develop chemical process designs that are not only technically and economically feasible but also environmental friendly. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool for identifying and quantifying environmental impacts of the chemical product and/or the process that makes it. It can be used in conjunction with process simulation and economic analysis tools to evaluate the design of any existing and/or new chemical-biochemical process and to propose improvement options in order to arrive at the best design among various alternatives. Although there are several commercial LCA tools, there is still a need for a simple LCA software that can be integrated with process design tools. In this paper, a new LCA software, LCSoft, is developed for evaluation of chemical, petrochemical, and biochemical processes with options for integration with other process design tools such as sustainable design (SustainPro), economic analysis (ECON) and process simulation. The software framework contains four main tools: Tool-1 is for life cycle inventory (LCI) knowledge management that enables easy maintenance and future expansion of the LCI database; Tool-2 is for estimation of environmental impact characterization factors using group contribution + method (GC)+ in order to calculate environmental impacts for a wide range of chemicals; Tool-3 performs LCA calculations based on a library of models; and, Tool-4 provides interfaces for integration with other tools. To test the software, a bioethanol production process using cassava rhizome is employed as a case study. Results from LCSoft highlight the estimated environmental performance in terms of various aspects such as carbon footprint, resource and energy consumptions, and various environmental impacts. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, there are limitations in the existing literature for estimating DW with a consistent classification system. Building information modeling (BIM) is a technology that can generate and manage all the information required during the life cycle of a building, from design to demolition. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of research regarding its application to the demolition stage of a building. For an effective waste management plan, the estimation of the type and volume of DW should begin from the building design stage. However, the lack of tools hinders an early estimation. This study proposes a BIM-based framework that estimates DW in the early design stages, to achieve an effective and streamlined planning, processing, and management. Specifically, the input of construction materials in the Korean construction classification system and those in the BIM library were matched. Based on this matching integration, the estimates of DW by type were calculated by applying the weight/unit volume factors and the rates of DW volume change. To verify the framework, its operation was demonstrated by means of an actual BIM modeling and by comparing its results with those available in the literature. This study is expected to contribute not only to the estimation of DW at the building level, but also to the automated estimation of DW at the district level.},

This article describes how material stocks in buildings and their spatial distribution can be analyzed on a city level. In particular, the building structure (buildings differentiated by construction period and utilization) of Vienna is analyzed by joining available geographical information systems (GIS) data from various municipal authorities. Specific material intensities for different building categories (differentiated by construction period and utilization) are generated based on multiple data sources on the material composition of different building types and combined with the data on the building structure. Utilizing these methods, the overall material stock in buildings in Vienna was calculated to be 380 million metric tonnes (t), which equals 210 t per capita (t/cap). The bulk of the material (>96\%) is mineral, whereas organic materials (wood, plastics, bitumen, and so on) and metals (iron/steel, copper, aluminum, and so on) constitute a very small share, of which wood (4.0 t/cap) and steel (3.2 t/cap) are the major contributors. Besides the overall material stock, the spatial distribution of materials within the municipal area can be assessed. This research forms the basis for a resource cadaster, which provides information about gross volume, construction period, utilization, and material composition for each building in Vienna.},

Overall, the typologies consist of two types of building models - real example models and average designed models. The main purpose of developing the building typologies was to establish a tool able to calculate different energy-saving scenarios for the entire residential building stock. To make such calculations of scenarios, similar average designed building models were established based on extracted average values from the Danish Energy Performance Certification Scheme database. The two building typologies had the same overall composition, i.e., three main building types: single-family houses, terraced houses and blocks of flats. Each main building type is presented for nine periods representing age, typical building tradition and insulation levels. Finally, an energy balance model of the residential building stock was devised to validate the average designed building models. Compared with the official statistics on energy consumption in Denmark 2010, the results showed a difference below 4\%. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An expected increase in scrap supply in coming decades necessitates restructuring of the aluminum cycle to open up new recycling paths for alloys and avoid a potential scrap surplus. This paper explores various interventions in end-of-life management and recycling of automotive aluminum, using a dynamic substance flow analysis model of aluminum and its alloying elements with resolution on component and alloy level (vehicle-component-alloy-element model). It was found that increased component dismantling before vehicle shredding can be an effective, so far underestimated, intervention in the medium term, especially if combined with development of safety-relevant components such as wheels from secondary material. In the long term, automatic alloy sorting technologies are most likely required, but could at the same time reduce the need for magnesium removal in refining. Cooperation between the primary and secondary aluminum industries, the automotive industry, and end-of-life vehicle dismantlers is therefore essential to ensure continued recycling of automotive aluminum and its alloying elements. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

In this study, we developed such an urban resource cadaster through an integration of the geo-localized, bottom-up material stock analysis with primary data on building material intensity coefficients for a case of Odense, the third largest city in Denmark that is undergoing major construction works. We quantified the total amount and spatial (including vertical) distribution of 46 construction materials stocked in buildings (residential and nonresidential), roads, and pipe networks (wastewater, water supply, and natural gas). In total, 66.7 megatons (or 329 tons per capita) of construction materials are stocked in Odense, in which aboveground stock only makes up for a third of the weight but hosts a wide variety of materials. This urban resource cadaster at high resolution can inform a variety of stakeholders along the value chain of the construction industry to better plan for construction materials and component recovery and smart waste management.},

To this purpose, it is, therefore, essential to improve knowledge on the composition of the existing building stock. In this work, by analysing and processing the quantitative and qualitative data available from different countries, it has been possible to define an accurate building technologies map showing both the seismic-resistant structures and the envelope systems, the latter to evaluate also the environmental behaviour of buildings in terms of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and energetic consumptions. Afterwards, the seismic and climatic characteristics of all the European countries have been considered, so leading towards the definition of zones with different combined hazard conditions. Through all the possible combinations between these seismic and climatic zones, it has been conceived a hazard matrix, where different case studies can be placed aiming at showing potentialities of different retrofit solutions from seismic and energy viewpoints. The investigation of these case studies, which will be analysed in a companion paper, allows to cover all the possible constructions and hazards detected at European level, so to implement an analysis method to be used in every Countries in Europe.},

The pre-consumer waste footprint concept was tested to analyse 10 generic products, which provided some novel and interesting results for the different product categories and identified a number of challenges that need to be resolved in development of the waste footprint concept. These challenges include standardised data declaration on waste in life cycle assessment, with a separation into waste categories illustrating the implicit environmental and scale of significance of waste types and quantities (e.g. hazardous waste, inert waste, waste for recycling/incineration) and establishment of a common definition of waste throughout sectors and nations.},

The average environmental impacts have been calculated taking into consideration the number of dwellings (clustered per typology, year of construction and climate zone) related to each representative model. System boundaries include production, construction, use (energy and water consumption), maintenance/replacement, and end-of-life phases of each dwelling. The environmental life cycle impact assessment was carried out using the ILCD method. EU average annual environmental impact per person, per dwelling, and per m2 were calculated. Results show that the average life cycle greenhouse gases emissions related to housing per person per year are 2.62 t CO2eq and related to a representative dwelling per year are of 6.36 t CO2eq. The use phase (energy and water consumption) is the most relevant one, followed by the production and the maintenance/replacement phases. Single-family houses are responsible for the highest share of impacts related to housing in Europe. The same type of building has different impacts in different climatic zones, due to the differences in the need for space heating. In general, electricity use and space heating are the activities that contribute more to the overall impacts. The final results could be used as a baseline scenario for testing eco-innovation scenarios and setting targets toward impact reduction.},

As one of the largest waste streams, they have a considerable potential for the reduction of waste generation, landfilling, and primary raw material consumption. To make use of this potential, sustainable development strategies of many cities include a circular management of CDW by measures in line with the waste hierarchy. The present study uses material flow analysis to determine how waste reduction, re-use and recycling of mineral CDW generated in a city can contribute to reduce the demand of raw material imports for construction minerals, using the case study of the city of Vienna. The results show that the annual consumption of construction minerals of 4.5 million tons can be reduced by 32\% to 3 million tons by implementing the waste hierarchy to CDW. The most important measures are the use of recycling materials from mineral construction and demolition waste as recycling aggregate in concrete (575,000 t/yr), followed by the use of recycling material to substitute gravel in unbound form (463,000 t/yr), avoiding the demolition of historical buildings by extending their service life (230,000 t/yr), asphalt recycling (85,000 t/yr), and substitution of raw-mix in cement by recycling material from debris (84,000 t/yr). Re-use of full bricks (17,000 t/yr) is of lesser relevance. To implement this enhanced circularity scenario, however, efforts in installed technology, construction and demolition waste management as well as legal and entrepreneurial measures are required.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: Some LCA software tools use precalculated aggregated datasets because they make LCA calculations much quicker. However, these datasets pose problems for uncertainty analysis. Even when aggregated dataset parameters are expressed as probability distributions, each dataset is sampled independently. This paper explores why independent sampling is incorrect and proposes two techniques to account for dependence in uncertainty analysis. The first is based on an analytical approach, while the other uses precalculated results sampled dependently. Methods: The algorithm for generating arrays of dependently presampled aggregated inventories and their LCA scores is described. These arrays are used to calculate the correlation across all pairs of aggregated datasets in two ecoinvent LCI databases (2.2, 3.3 cutoff). The arrays are also used in the dependently presampled approach. The uncertainty of LCA results is calculated under different assumptions and using four different techniques and compared for two case studies: a simple water bottle LCA and an LCA of burger recipes. Results and discussion: The meta-analysis of two LCI databases shows that there is no single correct approximation of correlation between aggregated datasets. The case studies show that the uncertainty of single-product LCA using aggregated datasets is usually underestimated when the correlation across datasets is ignored and that the magnitude of the underestimation is dependent on the system being analysed and the LCIA method chosen. Comparative LCA results show that independent sampling of aggregated datasets drastically overestimates the uncertainty of comparative metrics. The approach based on dependently presampled results yields results functionally identical to those obtained by Monte Carlo analysis using unit process datasets with a negligible computation time. Conclusions: Independent sampling should not be used for comparative LCA. Moreover, the use of a one-size-fits-all correction factor to correct the calculated variability under independent sampling, as proposed elsewhere, is generally inadequate. The proposed approximate analytical approach is useful to estimate the importance of the covariance of aggregated datasets but not for comparative LCA. The approach based on dependently presampled results provides quick and correct results and has been implemented in EcodEX, a streamlined LCA software used by Nestl\'{e}. Dependently presampled results can be used for streamlined LCA software tools. Both presampling and analytical solutions require a preliminary one-time calculation of dependent samples for all aggregated datasets, which could be centrally done by database providers. The dependent presampling approach can be applied to other aspects of the LCA calculation chain.},

	abstract     = {Given the fast-growing demand for electric mobility, the European Union (EU) has invested in responsible sourcing of battery raw materials, but the sustainability of their value chains is not fully addressed. Life cycle sustainability assessment is a tool to identify social, economic, and environmental aspects of raw materials, but it is mostly used for negative impacts, whereas the supply and use of raw materials may also lead to benefits. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help to determine how raw materials boost or hinder the achievement of a sustainable society. In this study, the SDGs were used as a reference to assess contributions and risks of cobalt supply for electric mobility in the EU and whether this technology supports the achievement of the SDGs. The risks were determined using eight indicators focused on social risks, but environmental aspects like water quality and usage, and greenhouse gas emissions were also considered. The literature and databases were consulted to identify which SDGs receive contributions or burdens. Global and European cobalt supply scenarios were defined, considering the most representative countries. Results indicate that, although some SDGs receive positive contributions, like SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG 13 (Climate action), most of the identified correlations are negative, especially for SDG 3 (Good health and well-being) and SDG 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions). The European scenario has a low risk toward socio-environmental issues in 53\% of the assessed aspects, whereas the global scenario presents a high risk in 47\% of them.},

Therefore, this paper presents a model which allows technicians to estimate C\&D waste during the design stage in order to promote prevention and recovery. The types and quantities of CW are estimated and managed according to EU guidelines, by building elements and specifically for each project. The model would allow detection of the source of the waste and to adopt other alternative procedures which delete hazardous waste and reduce CW. Likewise, it develops a systematic structure of the construction process, a waste classification system and some analytical expressions which are based on factors. These factors depend on technology and represent a standard on site. It would allow to develop a database of waste anywhere. A Spanish case study is covered. Factors were obtained by studying over 20 dwellings. The source and types of packaging waste, remains, soil and hazardous waste were estimated in detail and were compared with other studies. Results reveal that the model can be implemented in projects and the chances of reducing and recovery C\&D waste could be increased, well above the EU challenge. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract     = {For sustainable design, technology developers need to consider not only technical and economic aspects but also potential environmental impacts while developing new technologies. Techno economic analysis (TEA) evaluates the technical performance and economic feasibility of a technology. Life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluates the potential environmental impacts associated with a product system throughout its life cycle from raw material extraction to disposal. Generally, TEA and LCA performed separately for technology assessment. Understanding of the trade-off between economic and environmental performance is crucial for sustainable process design, which is not fully available if TEA and LCA is performed separately. In contrast, integration of TEA and LCA enables systematic analysis of the relationships between technical, economic, and environmental performance and provides more information to technology developers for trade-off analysis. Integrated TEA-LCA tool can also reduce inconsistency between system boundaries, functional units, and assumptions that can arise from using standalone TEA and LCA findings in decision making. There is also growing interest of prospective application of integrated TEA-LCA tool to evaluate emerging technologies at early technology readiness level (TRL). Integration of TEA and LCA is still an evolving area and requires further exploration to develop a consistent methodological guideline. The goal of this study is to review the current state-of-the-art in TEA and LCA to identify the methodological challenges of TEA-LCA integration approaches. This study also identifies major challenges to perform integrated TEA-LCA analysis of emerging technologies at low TRLs. Lack of consistent methodological guidelines and compatible software tools, inconsistent system boundary and functional unit selection, limited data availability and uncertainty are key methodological challenges for integration of LCA and TEA. Future research should focus on developing integrated TEA-LCA tool, formulating approach to incorporate optimization method with integrated TEA-LCA tool, and developing strategy of proper communication of results from integrated LCA-TEA tool to broad range of stakeholders.},

To facilitate large diversity and a number of buildings for such analyses, this paper presents a methodology by which national building stocks may be aggregated through archetype buildings. The methodology has been implemented and verified in four EU countries in regions with different climates, namely France, Germany, Spain and the UK. These countries account for about half of the final energy consumption of the EU-28 buildings. The analysis includes the residential and non-residential sectors (residential sector only for Germany). The number of archetypes per country has been defined according to different categories of building type, construction year, climate region and the main fuel source for heating purposes. The accuracy of the description is validated by simulating energy demand using the ECCABS Building Stock Model, and comparing the final energy demand modeled with corresponding statistical data. The total final energy demand calculated for these countries differs from available statistics by between-6\% and+2\%, which is considered satisfactory. The proposed description of the building stock is being used as a basis for analyzing the potential for and cost of energy conservation measures. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

An efficient and sustainable process for their recovery from biomass, however, remains elusive. This work aimed to develop a separation cascade for MCFA recovery from fermentation broth (FB) using membrane filtration. This technical-scale process consisted of a filter-press, thermal-pretreatment, ultrafiltration (UF), and nanofiltration (NF). While solid–liquid separation and UF were efficient, NF fluxes declined rapidly due to membrane fouling, limiting MCFA separation and concentration. Thermal pretreatment and UF membrane pore size had a negligible effect on filtration performance and diafiltration trials in NF proved ineffective. While process feasibility is presently constrained by membrane fouling in NF, characterization, and reduction of foulants could make the process readily viable. Overall, the membrane filtration cascade yielded a product, the NF retentate, with an MCFA concentration approximately 230\% greater than that of the feedstock with an average overall recovery of 84\%. Furthermore, although the concentration of MCFAs (C4-C8, 12.9 g L–1) may be inadequate for direct use, this product, being clarified and enriched, could serve as an improved feedstock for MCFA purification by alternative methods.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an internationally accepted method to assess the environmental impacts of buildings. A major methodological challenge remains the modelling of the end-of-life stage of buildings and allocation of benefits and burdens between systems. Various approaches are hence applied in practice to date. This paper compares the two methods widely renowned in Europe--the EC product environmental footprint (PEF) method and the CEN standards: EN 15804+A1 and EN15978--and offers insights about their fitness for achieving circularity goals. Methods: The EC PEF method and the CEN EN 15804/EN 15978 standards were methodologically analysed with a focus on the end-of-life modelling and allocation approach and were applied to a building case study. The EN 15804+A1 standard explains the guidelines but does not offer a modelling formula. Accordingly, this paper proposes a formula for the CEN standards using identical parameters as in the end-of-life circular footprint formula (CFF) of the EC PEF Guidance v6.3 to increase consistency among LCA studies. The calculation formulas were then applied to a newly constructed office building. A comparative analysis of both the implementation and results are described, and recommendations are formulated. Results: In the absence of databases compatible with the two LCA methods and comprising all building products, the Ecoinvent datasets had to be remodelled to enable a comparative modular assessment. This proved to be a laborious process. The EC PEF method and CEN standards showed similar impacts and hotspots for the case study building. The module D in the CEN standards includes a significant share of positive impacts, but due to collective accounting, it does not clearly communicate these benefits. The summation of burdens and benefits in the EC PEF method reduces its transparency, while the allocation and quality factors enable this method to better capture the market realities and drive circular economy goals. Conclusions: The construction sector and the LCI database developers are encouraged to create the missing LCA databases compatible with the modular and end-of-life allocation modelling requirements of both methods. More prescriptive and meticulous guidelines, with further harmonization between the EC PEF method and the CEN standards and their end-of-life allocation formula, would largely increase comparability and reliability of LCA studies and communications. To improve transparency, it is recommended to report the module D impacts per life cycle stage as per the CEN standards and the burdens and benefits separately for each life cycle stage as per the EC PEF method.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: Built in 1941, the Progreso Pier was the first concrete structure in the world built with nickel-containing stainless steel reinforcement. The Pier has been in service for over 70~years without any significant repair or maintenance activities. The aim of this study was to understand the environmental and economic implications of selecting nickel-containing stainless steel reinforcement using the Progreso Pier as the case study. Methods: A combined environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) study was conducted. The analysis considered the potential environmental impacts and the net present cost of the stainless steel reinforced structure from cradle to grave and compared it to the same structure using conventional carbon steel. Results and discussion: The results indicated that while using stainless steel reinforcement resulted in a marginally higher environmental impact after initial construction, this is offset by the increased service life and, hence, less frequent maintenance and reconstruction activities. Relative to the as-built stainless steel reinforcement design, the environmental impacts of the carbon steel reinforced design are between 69 and 79~\% higher over the analysis period. Similar observations were made for the other investigated impact categories. The cost implications of using stainless steel reinforcement show economic benefits that are complementary to the environmental benefits. Similar to the LCA, the service life benefits outweigh the higher unit costs for stainless steel, assuming a discount rate of 0.01~\% as the baseline scenario. The carbon steel reinforced design has a net present cost that is 44~\% higher than the as-built stainless steel reinforcement design. The crossover point for the two designs occurs at year 50, which corresponds to the reconstruction activity. A sensitivity analysis shows that the results and conclusions are sensitive to the choice in discount rate: Rates 3~\% and lower produce net present costs that are lower for the as-built design; rates 4~\% and higher produce net present costs that are lower for the alternative design. Conclusions: The study demonstrates how LCA and LCC are complementary tools that can be used in decision-making for sustainable construction. The Progreso Pier exemplifies the importance of considering the entire life cycle with service life and recycling as well as long-term life cycle impacts of infrastructure projects from an environmental and economic perspective.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: To support the data requirements of stakeholders, the Nickel Institute (NI) conducted a global life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to show, with indicators, the potential environmental impacts of the production of nickel and ferronickel from mine to refinery gate. A metal industry wide agreed approach on by-products and allocation was applied. Methods: Nine companies, comprising 19 operations, contributed data, representing 52~\% of global nickel metal production and 40~\% of global ferronickel production. All relevant pyro- and hydrometallurgical production routes were considered, across most major nickel-producing regions. Data from Russia, the biggest nickel-producing nation, was included; the Chinese industry did not participate. 2011 was chosen as reference year for data collection. The LCIA applied allocation of impacts of by-products using both economic and mass allocations. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to further understand the relevance and impact of the different allocation approaches. Results and discussion: The primary extraction and refining steps are the main contributors to primary energy demand (PED) and global warming potential (GWP), contributing 60 and 70~\% to the PED for the production of 1~kg class I nickel and 1~kg nickel in ferronickel, respectively, and over 55~\% of the GWP for both nickel products. The PED for 1~kg class 1 nickel was calculated to be 147~MJ, whilst the PED for 1~kg nickel in ferronickel was calculated to be three times higher at 485~MJ. The main factors influencing energy demand in the metallurgical processes are ore grade and ore mineralogy. Sulphidic ore is less energy intensive to process than oxidic ore. Eighty-six percent of the production volume from class 1 nickel producers, in this study, is from sulphidic ore. All ferronickel was produced from oxidic ore. The LCIA results, including a sensitivity analysis of the impact of producers with higher and lower PED, reflect the influence of the production route on energy demand and on environmental impact categories. Conclusions: Conformant to relevant ISO standards, and backed-up with a technical and critical review, this LCIA quantifies the environmental impacts associated with the production of the main nickel products. With this study, a sound background dataset for downstream users of nickel has been provided. The Nickel Institute aims to update their data in the coming years to reflect upon changes in technology, energy efficiency, and raw material input.},

Today, architects can compare the environmental performance of different building designs with an online calculation tool that incorporates the national LCA method. However, they are still lacking environmental benchmarks to position themselves within current building practice. Furthermore, such benchmarks play an important role in the development of environmental targets in building regulation. In this research, benchmarks are defined for new residential buildings in Belgium. A bottom-up approach is followed consisting of a statistical analysis of reference buildings to define limit, reference and best practice values. The buildings are based on four representative typologies for Belgium, ranging from detached houses to apartments. Different variants are assessed including various energy performance levels and construction types (solid versus timber). The buildings' life cycle impacts are calculated including the embodied (material) and operational (energy) impacts. Results are reported both for an aggregated environmental single-score and for Global Warming Potential (GWP). The calculated reference values for life cycle and embodied GWP (20 and 7 kgCO2eq/m2.year) are comparable to existing benchmarks in the literature. The results further highlight that building compactness provides the largest impact reduction, followed by construction type. Finally, limitations are discussed and recommendations are formulated for developing future benchmarks.},

However, developing an effective waste management strategy requires a thorough understanding of waste types and quantites. The existing efforts to identify waste flows in the built environment are unsuitable for countries with non-reliable statistics as they mostly use location-specific parameters such as data on construction, renovation, demolition activity, and generation rates from the literature. The types and quantities of materials embedded are rarely considered. This study aims to fill the identified gap by estimating the quantities of different material types embedded in Serbian residential building stock. It will do so by calculating the volume and weights of building elements and their materials using information from a detailed building stock typology. The results show that the amounts of materials embedded vary significantly from district to district, ranging from 10 in Topli\v{c}ka District to 96.9 million tons in Belgrade. The mineral materials are the highest contributors to the material embedded, implying that future waste management strategies should focus on them. Apart from the formulation of location-specific circular economy and waste management strategies, these results may be useful for planning energy efficiency retrofitting activities, deconstruction and reversible design strategies.},

LCA has been used by CSIRO Minerals to assess the "cradle-to-gate" environmental impacts of a number of metal production processes practised either currently or potentially in Australia. The metals considered included copper, nickel, aluminium, lead, zinc, steel, stainless steel and titanium, by both pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical routes in some instances. The environmental profile included greenhouse and acid rain gas emissions, solid waste emissions and gross energy consumption. The results for various metals are compared in this paper. New process technologies for primary metal production can be expected to reduce the environmental impacts of metal production, and estimates of likely reductions for technologies involving stainless steel, titanium and aluminium are also presented in this paper. \textcopyright{} 2006.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: The International Aluminium Institute's (IAI) aim was to publish life cycle inventory (LCI) data for use by life cycle assessment (LCA) practitioners through professional databases. The need to provide robust data stems from the increasing application of LCA as a tool for making material and design choices and the importance for representative, up-to-date information to underpin such studies. In addition to this, the institute aimed to evaluate the significance of potential environmental impacts, based on the LCI results, against a defined set of impact categories which can be tracked over time. Methods: Key environmental data collected as part of the IAI's long-running industry surveys provided the foundation for the life cycle inventory. In order to evaluate the environmental impact, direct input and output data for primary aluminium production were supplemented with background data for indirect processes available in GaBi version 6 (PE International, 2013b). A cradle-to-gate model was constructed with two distinct datasets, global (GLO) and global minus China (rest of world (RoW)). A partial life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) was completed using the models, and the following six CML (2001–Nov 2010) midpoint environmental impact categories were reported: acidification potential, depletion of fossil energy resources, eutrophication potential, global warming potential, ozone depletion potential and photo-oxidant creation potential. Water scarcity footprint of primary aluminium (Buxmann et al. in this issue) was also included. Results and discussion: The results indicated that the largest greenhouse gas contributions were attributed to the alumina refining and electrolysis unit processes in both datasets, with electricity and thermal energy, being the major contributing factors to these higher values. The energy intensive nature of primary aluminium production means energy supply can significantly influence the overall environmental impact. Electricity production was found to contribute between 25 \% and 80 \% to all impact category indicator results, with higher values in the global dataset, a result of the inclusion of Chinese energy data and the increased share of coal-based electricity consumption that it represents. Conclusions: The global aluminium industry remains dedicated to transparent reporting of its environmental impacts and ensuring that up-to-date, representative LCI data is available. Development of suitable methodologies for new indicators will be required to ensure that the industry continues to report accurately all its relevant impacts. Additionally, with the increased importance of Chinese aluminium production, inclusion of foreground data from Chinese production would further enhance the dataset from which the global impacts of aluminium production are assessed from cradle to gate.},

Related cumulative energy use, global warming potential, human health implications and ecosystem damage are estimated by metal life cycle stage (i.e., mining, purification, and refining). For some elements, these are the first life cycle estimates of environmental impacts reported in the literature. We show that, if compared on a per kilogram basis, the platinum group metals and gold display the highest environmental burdens, while many of the major industrial metals (e.g., iron, manganese, titanium) are found at the lower end of the environmental impacts scale. If compared on the basis of their global annual production in 2008, iron and aluminum display the largest impacts, and thallium and tellurium the lowest. With the exception of a few metals, environmental impacts of the majority of elements are dominated by the purification and refining stages in which metals are transformed from a concentrate into their metallic form. Out of the 63 metals investigated, 42 metals are obtained as coproducts in multi output processes. We test the sensitivity of varying allocation rationales, in which the environmental burden are allocated to the various metal and mineral products, on the overall results. Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to further investigate the stability of our results. This analysis is the most comprehensive life cycle comparison of metals to date and allows for the first time a complete bottom-up estimate of life cycle impacts of the metals and mining sector globally. We estimate global direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 at 3.4 Gt CO2-eq per year and primary energy use at 49 EJ per year (9.5\% of global use), and report the shares for all metals to both impact categories. \textcopyright{} 2014 Nuss, Eckelman.},

From an `urban mining' perspective, the building stock can be seen as a repository of natural resources. In order to manage this repository, evidence is needed on its quantity and dynamics. Although data exist for domestic buildings, little evidence exists for non-domestic buildings. A new method is presented to quantify the material stock of non-domestic buildings – based on the German building stock. The quantification process involves three steps: (1) material composition indicators (MCIs) are calculated with respect to various building types; (2) the country's total floor space is estimated and disaggregated; and (3) the total material stock is calculated. The main results are MCIs and the floor space for both domestic and non-domestic stocks, as well as the material mass in total. In Germany the total material mass of non-domestic buildings is approximately 6.8 billion tonnes, accounting for 44\% of the entire building stock. The method can be adapted and validated for use in other countries. These results will assist both policy-makers and the construction industry to understand the potential for moving toward a more circular economy.},

Therefore, cities and governments need to develop strategies to reduce both the consumption of resources during usage phase as well as the embodied impact of the current building stock. This article proposes a new component-based building inventory database as a basis to develop such strategies using building stock modeling. The developed database clusters the building stock according to building typology (singlefamily houses, multifamily houses, and office buildings), age, and the main construction systems of the different building components. Based on the component makeup, it lists the necessary material input and waste output for different refurbishment options for each building component. The advantages of the proposed database structure are shown based on two applications for the developed database for Switzerland. The componentbased database allows optimization of refurbishment strategies not only from an energetic perspective, but also with respect to materials, both on the input (sourcing of materials) and the output (waste streams) level. The database structure makes it possible to continuously extend the data set by adding new refurbishment options or add data such as componentspecific lifetimes, costs, or labor intensities of the refurbishment options. In combination with an aligned economic model, this would give an even more holistic view, impact, and feasibility of different refurbishment scenarios both in environmental and economic terms.},

	abstract     = {A life cycle assessment (LCA) practitioner is often faced with the problem of missing chemical life cycle inventory (LCI) data sets, as current databases cover only a small fraction of chemicals used in commerce. Here, we critically review eight different methods used by LCA practitioners to estimate missing chemical LCI data, including process simulation, engineering process calculations, molecular structure-based models, stoichiometric approaches, use of proxies, and omission. Each method is technically described with examples from the literature, description of advantages and disadvantages, and discussion of suitability depending on availability of data and expertise. Methods are then fully demonstrated and compared for accuracy against reported chemical industry data using case studies of styrene and its downstream product, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). Resulting LCI and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) values are compared and discussed, with specific attention to method-specific exclusion of particular flows. Out of the four methods with which full LCIs can be generated, the advanced process-based methods give the most accurate life cycle GHG emission results for styrene and ABS, compared to plant data. Stoichiometric calculations, which are the most commonly used approach, underestimate the actual global warming results by 35-50\%. Among the 18 impact categories of the ReCiPe LCIA method, results for the estimated LCI data were within 10\% of the actual plant results for only 4-5 categories. Based on the critical review and demonstration results, we provide recommendations for appropriate use of LCI estimation methods in various LCA modeling situations.},

However, life-cycle inventory (LCI) data of individual pharmaceutical drugs is limited to only a few compounds. In this study, we use chemical engineering methods for process scale-up and process design to utilize lab-scale synthesis data, available in patents and other public literature, to generate cradle-to-gate LCI data of 20 commonly used injectable drugs in anesthesia care to calculate their greenhouse gas impact. During the process of building the life-cycle trees of these drugs, missing life-cycle inventories for more than 130 other chemical compounds and pharmaceutical intermediates were accounted for using process-based methods and stoichiometric calculations. The cradle-to-gate GHG emissions of the 20 anesthetic drugs range from 11 kg CO2 eq. for succinylcholine to 3,000 kg CO2 eq. for dexmedetomidine. GHG emissions are positively correlated with the number of synthesis steps in the manufacturing of the drug. The LCI methods and data generated in this work greatly expand the available environmental data on APIs and can serve as a guide for LCA practitioners in future analysis of other pharmaceutical drugs. Most importantly, these LCA results can be used by clinical practitioners and administrators building toward sustainability in the health care sector.},

The distinctive character of these problems resulted in different modelling workflows and archetypes being developed. The building retrofitting case followed a hybrid approach, integrating statistical and physical perspectives, estimating energy savings for 5532 buildings from seven retrofitting packages. The electric heating case provided an explicitly statistical data-driven view of the problem, estimating potential for improvement of power capacity of the local electric grid at peak electric power of 147 MW. The conclusion was that the growing availability of linked building energy data requires a shift in the urban building energy modelling (UBEM) paradigm from single-logic models to on-request multiple-purpose data intelligence services.},

	abstract     = {The steel industry is currently a major water pollution source, releasing high quantities of chemicals. One of the pollutants is phenol, known for its toxicity even when it is present in low concentrations. Liquid-liquid extraction employing various aromatics and cycloalkanes (i.e., benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, ethylbenzene) and ketones (i.e., methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide) as solvents, is studied in the present paper. A comparison among the seven solvents is performed based on process modelling simulation tools and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The simulations of the seven cases under study are conducted at the same wastewater flowrate of 100 tons/h, with a phenol content of 0.2 wt.\% and compared using various parameters (i.e., quantity of solvent, steam and power used, quantity of solvent present in the output phenol streams). The simulation results show that the lowest quantity of solvent is registered in the phenol removal which uses cyclohexanone as solvent (e.g., 34,212.40 kg/h), followed by the case which uses mesityl oxide for the liquid-liquid extraction (e.g., 34,759.80 kg/h) and by the case involving cyclohexanone (e.g., 37,490.60 kg/h). The lowest steam consumption is registered also in the case of cyclohexanone usage (e.g., 47.56 GJ/h) while the lowest power consumption corresponds to mesityl oxide usage (e.g., 11.20 MJ/h). The simulation results are then used to perform an environmental analysis, quantified in terms of environmental key performance indicators, embedding several solvents production methods as well as various fuels. Our life cycle assessment leads to the conclusions that the most environmentally friendly design is phenol removal using cyclohexanone as a solvent, whose provision comes from cyclohexane, which in turn is produced from benzene in conjunction with steam production from natural gas. For instance, the lowest global warming potential indicator score is about 342 kg CO2 equivalents per kg of phenol, while the same indicator for the worst solvent, i.e., toluene produced using reforming technology and steam being produced using hard coal as fuel, is almost double (e.g., 341.94 kg CO2 equivalents per kg of phenol vs. 575.30 CO2 equivalents per kg of phenol). Lower values for other impact indicators are also obtained in the phenol removal using cyclohexanone as a solvent with steam being generated form natural gas (e.g., acidification potential indicator is 0.42 kg SO2 equivalents per kg of phenol, eutrophication potential is 4.21 \texttimes{} 10-2 kg PO43- equivalents per kg phenol, ozone depletion potential is 1.13 \texttimes{} 10-9 kg R11 equivalents per kg phenol).},

This data paper presents an analysis and classification of the Swiss building stock based on the data found in the database. The objective is to create a knowledge foundation that can be used in future research on the performance of existing buildings. Using a sample of almost 50,000 buildings and a Python script, datasheets were created for single-family houses and multi-family houses for nine construction periods. These archetypes are described through selected available energy-related parameters, such as energy reference area, U-values, and energy source with indicators such as median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile or distributions. The resulting data can be used for different purposes: (1) to calibrate energy models; (2) for analysis that requires scaling-up strategies to the whole stock; and (3) to identify weak and/or relevant classes of buildings throughout the stock.},

With an increasing trend in the demand for LIBs, the sustainability prospect of LIBs lifecycle faces many challenges that require proactive approaches. There are various sustainability challenges and risks across the supply and value chains of LIBs from mining, material supplies to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), users to final disposal. Risks are for example the increased raw material demands as well as some economic risks due to price increment or political instabilities in some countries within the raw material supply chain. Despite the promising research efforts on the performance metrics of LIBs and advancing the technology, the research on the various aspects of sustainability of LIBs and its life cycle are still in its infancy and require closer attention. As the editorial of the Special Issue on sustainable supply and value chains of EV batteries, this article presents some of the most pressing challenges of EV LIBs across the different stages of its life cycle. It covers issues from supply and demand of the battery raw materials, battery manufacturing, use, and end-of-life treatments. Within this context the reported findings of some 20 different research teams from across the globe, the state-of-the-art, technical or policy gaps in EV LIBs research and development are presented, as well as market instruments such as innovative business models, and governmental interventions like subsidies or regulations. We grouped the materials presented into five main themes (1) EV and LIB materials demand projections (2) EV LIBs international trade risk (3) EV battery regulation and adoption (4) EV LIBs life cycle assessment (5) and EV LIBs reverse logistics. We conclude by discussing some future research challenges such as the need for more reliable and applicable prediction models that use accurate data on EV stock and end-of-life EVs. Finally, we argue that more collaboration between academia, manufactures, OEMs and the battery recycling industry is needed to implement successful circular economy strategies to achieve environmentally friendly, flexible and cost-efficient battery supplies, use and recycling processes.},

Driven by the growing use of digital tools and technologies and by the first publication of ISO 12006-2 in 2001, this research topic has become incredibly popular in recent years. However, the absence of accurate historical traceability in the literature makes it difficult to understand the origin and evolution of the most prominent classification systems. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of selected commonly used classification systems published in the last seven decades, delving into those developed in Sweden, the UK and the USA/Canada. Furthermore, the latest classification system launched by each of these countries (CoClass, Uniclass 2015 and OmniClass\textregistered{}, respectively) has been chosen to analyse, compare and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. The results of this research show that there is no consensus on the use of a common international classification system for the built environment. Although organisations worldwide are working diligently towards an internationally accepted standard classifier, the use of national classification systems still prevails. The main gaps to be bridged in this area are discussed in the paper and can be summarised as follows: (i) barriers are found to classify construction elements of residential buildings in a consistent, unambiguous and standardised manner, (ii) commonly used classification systems are designed so that the information required is acquired during the design and construction stages, and (iii) further work is needed to address the challenges of properly classifying construction elements at the operation and maintenance stage.},

There is a growing need to use classification systems in a BIM context. In international construction projects and international construction product trade there is a need both to translate between national classification systems and to develop common systems. The idea behind the international framework standard for building classification ISO 12006-2 is that national systems would be easier to compare if they adhere to the class definitions suggested in the standard. A study of two classification systems, the BSAB system in Sweden and the DBK system in Denmark, both within the framework and yet not compatible, has risen the idea of a deeper analysis of the theoretical basis for the ISO 12006-2 classification system to find a solution to this problem. The project has developed such a theoretical framework in order to clarify the relationship between classes representing parts of buildings in the ISO 12006-2 standard, specifically the Construction entity part, Element and Work result classes. This is specifically needed when the standard is used in the context of BIM, since building models include both specialization and compositional relations among information objects representing parts of buildings. The proposed theoretical framework is based on a systems view on the built environment that distinguishes constructions in four main compositional levels: construction entities, technical systems, building elements and components. Based on the theoretical framework developed in this project, possible new interpretations of the classification standard ISO 12006-2 are discussed.},

Yet, as energy systems and industries are rapidly shifting towards cleaner means of production, pLCA requires an inventory database that encapsulates the expected changes in technologies and the environment at a given point in time, following specific socio-techno-economic pathways. To this end, this study introduces premise, a tool to streamline the generation of prospective inventory databases for pLCA by integrating scenarios generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). More precisely, premise applies a number of transformations on energy-intensive activities found in the inventory database ecoinvent according to projections provided by the IAM. Unsurprisingly, the study shows that, within a given socio-economic narrative, the climate change mitigation target chosen affects the performance of nearly all activities in the database. This is illustrated by focusing on the effects observed on a few activities, such as systems for direct air capture of CO2, lithium-ion batteries, electricity and clinker production as well as freight transport by road, in relation to the applied sector-based transformation and the chosen climate change mitigation target. This work also discusses the limitations and challenges faced when coupling IAM and LCA databases and what improvements are to be brought in to further facilitate the development of pLCA.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: This study focuses on the environmental assessment of European copper production. Life cycle assessment is applied to analyse copper cathode production in Sweden, including its mining (an open-pit mine) and refining (pyrometallurgy), and using two combinations of software and databases: SimaPro software with ecoinvent database and GaBi software with GaBi database. The results are compared with results from other case studies from literature. Methods: A cradle-to-gate LCA was conducted considering 1 tonne of copper as functional unit. The inventory for the foreground system was elaborated using primary data gathered by the staff from the mine, the concentrator and the smelter. For the background data, LCA databases are used considering datasets for the Swedish market whenever possible. As the smelter has multiple useful outputs, economic allocation was applied at the inventory level. The calculation method CML-IA baseline 3.5 was considered for both combinations of software and database, reporting all the impact categories of the method plus the Cumulative Energy Demand. Results and discussion: The inventory of the system and the main environmental hotspots were presented, such as the explosives for blasting (due to their supply chain) or the electricity used in the concentrator. The results obtained with the two combinations of LCA software and databases yield large differences for categories such as abiotic depletion (7.5 times higher for SimaPro and ecoinvent), possibly due to differences in the system boundaries of the databases and the characterisation factors of the method. Although the case study has a relatively high cumulative energy demand (140/168 kMJ/tonne Cu) compared to other mines, its performance in global warming (3.5/4.7 tonne CO2eq/tonne Cu) is much better due to the low greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, which shows that the electricity mix is a key aspect. Conclusions: The environmental performance of mining depends partially on the specific conditions of the deposit, e.g., the ore grade and the mining type. LCA practitioners should consider the potential different results that can be obtained using different combinations of software and database and exert caution when comparing cases, especially for abiotic depletion, human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories. Finally, the use of renewable energies can be key to improve the environmental sustainability of copper production.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: The metal and mining industry routinely conducts life cycle assessment studies to monitor and document the potential environmental impacts of their products. These studies are typically conducted independently by the various commodity associations. To facilitate alignment of these methodologies, a working group comprised of interested industry organizations and their representatives was formed to propose uniform recommendations for key methodological choices. Methods: Existing methodologies used by the participating associations were reviewed to identify areas of alignment as well as areas which could benefit from discussions and alignment. Recommendations for selected topics were then developed through a series of moderated discussions among the participating organizations throughout 2012 and 2013. Efforts were taken in the creation of the document to ensure alignment with the international standards ISO 14040 (2006) and ISO 14044 (2006). Four methodology issues were chosen to be addressed with respect to industry alignment: system boundary, recycling allocation, co-product allocation, and impact assessment categories. Results and discussion: Recommendations for system boundary conclude that boundaries should include end-of-life disposal and recycling and, whenever possible, the product use phase, particularly for material and product comparison. For co-product allocation methods, the recommendations were based on the type of co-products being produced and included a range of options to guide practitioners' decisions. It was recommended for recycling allocation that practitioners use the avoided burden methodology. Lastly, for the life cycle impact assessment stage, it was recommended that life cycle assessments (LCAs) on metal and mining products should report the following impact categories: global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, photochemical oxidant creation potential, and ozone depletion potential. It was recommended that inclusion of other impact categories will be periodically re-evaluated by the metal industry. Further, the recommendation is that, while impact categories included are limited to the five above, all life cycle inventory (LCI) datasets themselves should contain accurate and comprehensive inventory data, given reasonable accessibility and data collection cost constraints. Conclusions: Methodological alignment for LCA studies in the metal and mining industry will lead to improved consistency and applicability of the LCA data and results. Specifically, these recommendations improve the consistency of decisions regarding system boundary, recycling allocation, co-product allocation, and impact assessment categories. Further research is suggested to improve the specificity of certain recommendations (e.g., allocation), as well as expand the scope of the harmonization efforts to include other methodological decisions.},

The production of chemicals through fermentation processes based on sugar feedstocks has the potential to considerably reduce the chemical industry's dependence on fossil-based feedstock; energy intensive, expensive processes; and capital-intensive plants. Succinic acid, a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid, is such a building block with a relatively modest existing market, but with much promise for future growth. The US Department of Energy identified succinic acid as one of the best targets and top value-added chemicals that could be derived from biomass via fermentation because living cells produce this compound naturally. Succinic acid is an important platform molecule, widely used as an intermediate for the production of numerous everyday consumer products, pharmaceuticals, and adhesives, representing a total immediate addressable market in excess of \$7.2. billion. In this article, an analysis of the current succinic acid market, biological-based production processes, the enzymatic regulation, and the recovery system of succinic acid are discussed.

The link between demand for crops in one region and impacts in other regions is referred to here as indirect land use change (iLUC) and includes deforestation, intensification and reduced consumption. Existing models for iLUC tend to ignore intensification and reduced consumption, they most often operate with arbitrary amortisation periods to allocate deforestation emissions over time, and the causal link between land occupation and deforestation is generally weakly established. This paper presents the conceptual framework required for a consistent modelling of iLUC in Life Cycle Assessment. It reports on a novel and biophysical iLUC model, in which amortisation is avoided by using discounted Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). The causal link between demand for land and land use changes is established through markets for land's production capacity. The iLUC model presented is generally applicable to all land use types, crops and regions of the world in typical LCA decision-making contexts focusing on the long-term effects of small-scale changes. The model's strengths and weaknesses are discussed.},

However, hydrogen production using polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis is not fully commercially deployed on a large scale and it has to be verified whether hydrogen produced with this electrolysis technology indeed may lead to environmental benefits in the future. For assessing new technologies and their future environmental impacts, the method of prospective life cycle assessment is well suited. As the further development of the technology as well as the general future situation are unknown, scenarios are developed using the morphological analysis method. These scenarios represent different possible future states with reduced material demand, improved system efficiency, or longer cell lifetime and lead to different potential results for the environmental impacts. Furthermore, the background system is also adapted to future situations using scenarios. The results indicate that the improvement of the electrolysis plant regarding efficiency, material demand, and cell lifetime leads to lower environmental impacts in all categories. This reduction in impact is rather small, as the electricity demand in operation currently dominates the results in most impact categories. In contrast, the projection of the background infrastructure into the future leads to strongly altered impact results. Half of the considered impact categories show strong decreasing impacts, while the other half is affected negatively. Global warming potential, for example, decreases by 92.0\% due to the projection of the infrastructure into 2050. This means that in this specific case, the transition of the background scenarios, which represent the future production infrastructure and particularly the future energy supply, has a significant impact on the environmental consequences. The improvement of the electrolysis plant contributes rather small reductions, which is, nevertheless, inevitable to achieve the overall goal of a fully renewable energy-based energy system.},

	abstract     = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely-used methodology for estimating the potential environmental impacts of technological systems in nature. Relative maturity of this method has been achieved thanks to recent standardization efforts, although there are still several challenges, particularly in the minerals industry where LCA still needs to be strengthened and extended in use. An exhaustive review of recent LCA studies on mining and mineral processing operations was conducted to identify how these have dealt with various methodological challenges. A total of twenty-nine studies were found, most of which focusing on developed regions and in three commodities: coal (28\%), aggregates (21\%), and copper ores (14\%). The source of data for background processes has been the Ecoinvent database in 45\% of the studies analyzed, whereas the SimaPro software has been the preferred LCA tool in 66\% of such studies. Although important advances have been made, significant issues remain. For instance, inconsistencies were found in the definition of the functional unit and system boundaries (temporal and technological). Further, the adoption of allocation criteria and the use of normalization and weighting in impact assessment have not been considered in most cases. While climate change was the main environmental hotspot (more than 90\% of the studies addressed this impact category), the impacts associated with water use and waste management have been overlooked in most studies. Furthermore, mining and processing operations have been described as generic, averaged values or as simple functional relationships between system inputs and outputs using parameters without physical significance (``black box models'') in several production chains, making it difficult to identify opportunities for environmental sustainability enhancement within the sector. The work then discusses the opportunity of improvement in LCA in the minerals industry through the incorporation of process simulation from a bottom-up perspective. Evidence from other industries and recent advances in the computational development of such tools for the mineral sector are reviewed, which suggests that there is an opportunity for reducing the epistemic uncertainty in future LCA studies of mining and processing operations through the combination of both approaches.},

	abstract     = {A uniform and comprehensive classification system, often referred to as taxonomy, is fundamental for the characterization of building portfolios for natural hazard risk assessment. A building taxonomy characterizes assets according to attributes that can influence the likelihood of damage due to the effects of natural hazards. Within the scope of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) initiative, a building taxonomy (GEM Building Taxonomy V2.0) was developed with the goal of classifying buildings according to their seismic vulnerability. This taxonomy contained 13 building attributes, including the main material of construction, lateral load-resisting system, date of construction and number of stories. Since its release in 2012, the taxonomy has been used by hundreds of experts working on exposure and risk modeling efforts. These applications allowed the identification of several limitations, which led to the improvement and expansion of this taxonomy into a new classification system compatible with multi-hazard risk assessment. This expanded taxonomy (named GED4ALL) includes more attributes and several details relevant for buildings exposed to natural hazards beyond earthquakes. GED4ALL has been applied in several international initiatives, enabling the identification of the most common building classes in the world, and facilitating compatibility between exposure models and databases of vulnerability and damage databases.},

The process has been successfully applied in the treatment of rare earth element-bearing permanent magnet leachates as an atom-efficient, reagent-free separation method. Using ~5 bar pressure, the solvent was dissolved into the aqueous system to displace the contained metal salts as solid precipitates. Treatments at distinct temperatures ranging from 20–31 \textdegree{}C enable crystallization of either lanthanide-rich or transition metal-rich products, with single-stage solute recovery of up to 95.9\% and a separation factor as high as 704. Separation factors increase with solution purity, suggesting feasibility for eco-friendly solution treatments in series and parallel to purify aqueous material streams. Staged treatments are demonstrated as capable of further improving the separation factor and purity of crystallized products. Upon completion of a crystallization, the solvent can be recovered with high efficiency at ambient pressure.

	abstract     = {Purpose: The environmental performance of products or services is often a result of a number of key decisions that shape their life cycles (e.g., techology choices). This paper introduces a modular LCA approach that is capable of reducing the effort involved in performing scenario analyses and optimization when several key choices along a product's value chain lead to many alternative life cycles. Methods: The main idea is that the value chain of a product can be divided into interconnected but exchangeable modules, which together represent a full life cycle. A module is comprised of unit processes from the practitioner's LCI database. The inputs, outputs, and system boundaries of each module can be tailored to the context of the studied system. Alternatives arise whenever multiple modules produce substitutable products. Unlike in conventional LCI databases, no copies are necessary to represent the same process with different inputs. A module-product matrix is used to store this information. It can be used as a basis for an automated scenario analysis of all alternatives or as an input to an optimization model. Results and discussion: Our approach is illustrated in two case studies: (1) Passenger car fuel choices are modeled by 15 modules representing 33 alternative value chains for diesel, petrol, natural gas and electric cars. The automated comparison of LCA results indicates that electric mobility is often the preferable option from a climate perspective, but impacts depend strongly on the electricity source. (2) A dynamic optimization model including stocks is built from eight modules to analyze the optimal use of wood for material and energy applications. Results indicate that although direct substitution benefits are higher for energy applications, cascading use of wood can maximize environmental performance over the entire life cycle. Conclusions: The modular LCA approach permits an efficient modeling and comparison of alternative product life cycles, enabling practitioners to focus on key decisions. It can be applied to exploit a potential that is hidden in LCI databases, which is that they contain many specific inventories but not all useful combinations in the context of scenario analyses. The user-defined level of abstraction that is introduced through modules can be helpful in the communication of LCA results. The modular approach also facilitates the integration of LCA and optimization as well as other industrial ecology methods. An open source software is provided to enable others to apply~and further develop our implementation of a modular LCA approach.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: Much progress has recently been made in modelling future background systems for LCA by including future scenario~data, e.g.~from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), into life cycle inventory (LCI) databases. A key problem is, however, that this yields potentially dozens of scenario LCI databases (i.e. LCI databases that represent different scenarios and reference years), instead of a single background database, which is very impractical for LCA modelling purposes. This paper proposes an approach to overcome this problem. Methods: The approach consists of transforming all scenario LCI databases into a single superstructure database and an associated scenario difference file. The superstructure database is also a regular LCI database, but is constructed to contain all unique exchanges (elementary and intermediate flows) and processes that exist across all scenario LCI databases. The scenario difference file stores the differences between all scenarios and can be used to turn the superstructure into a specific scenario LCI database. This is very fast as it can be done in memory during LCA calculations. Results and discussion: A key advantage of the superstructure approach is that a single LCI database can be used to represent different background systems. Therefore, the practitioner does not need to re-link a foreground system to multiple LCI databases, which is work-intensive and invites modelling errors. LCA results for all scenarios and reference years can be calculated automatically. We also illustrate how the superstructure approach has been implemented in the Activity Browser open source LCA software. Although this paper introduces the superstructure approach for background scenarios, it can also be used to model foreground scenarios, and even, as implemented in the Activity Browser, combinations of background and foreground scenarios. Finally, we briefly discuss further challenges that need to be addressed for a more widespread use of background scenarios in LCA. Conclusions: The superstructure approach presents a practical solution for making the use of future background scenarios more wide-spread and, therefore, to overcome the problem of performing prospective LCA with temporally inconsistent foreground and background systems. The implementation in the Activity Browser makes the approach available for anyone and may serve as inspiration for other LCA software to implement the superstructure approach or a similar concept. While this may be an important technical milestone, additional coordination between data providers, scenario generators, LCA practitioners, and software developers will be required to further facilitate~the use of background scenarios in prospective LCA~studies.},

Here, we compare carbon footprint (CF) results for products and services in the ecoinvent 3.4 cut-off and the hybrid version of EXIOBASE. While we find that there is good agreement for certain sectors, more than half of the matched products differ by more than a factor 2. Best fits are observed in the energy, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors, although deviations are substantial for renewable energy. Poorer fits are observed for waste treatment and mining sectors. Both databases have a limited differentiation in the service sector. Differences can, to some degree, be explained by methodological differences, such as system boundaries and approaches used to resolve multi-functionality, and data differences. The common finding that, due to incomplete economic coverage (truncation error), LCA-based CFs should be lower than EEIOA-based CFs, could not be confirmed. The comparison of CFs from LCA and EEIOA databases can provide additional insights into the uncertainties of CF results, which is important knowledge when guiding decision makers. An approach that uses the coefficient of variation to identify strategic database improvement potentials is also presented and highlights several product groups that could deserve additional attention in both databases. Further strategic database improvements are crucial to reduce uncertainties and increase the robustness of decision support that the industrial ecology community can provide for the economic transformations ahead of us.

	abstract     = {Reducing space heating demand from the residential building stock has been established as a crucial element of the energy transition across Europe. Focusing on Switzerland, this paper presents a bottom-up model (SwissRes) which allows to analyse the demand for space heating by building element and by building archetype (54 archetypes in total). The model is based on detailed data on the building envelope and heating systems of over 25,000 Cantonal Building Energy Performance Certificates (CECB PLUS). We identify three building characteristics which result in above-average final energy demand: rural typology (18\% higher than urban), single-family houses (41\% higher than multi-family) and in particular age of buildings (525\% higher from newest to oldest). In combination, these three factors can lead to up to seven times higher demand per m2 and year in extreme cases compared to the most efficient archetype. Among buildings constructed before 1970, single-family houses (SFH) show very high specific final energy demand for space heating ranging between 170 and 200 kWh/m\ensuremath{^2}. On the national level, SFHs and multi-family houses (MFH) are featuring almost identical shares of total final energy demand. Buildings in suburban areas account for almost 50\% of the total final energy demand. In total, the buildings constructed before 1980 account for 70\% of the national final energy demand for space heating, with buildings constructed before 1920 contributing 22\%. Most heat is lost through walls (40\%) followed by windows (25\%), roofs (17\%) and the floor (18\%). Losses from walls are particular high (73 kWh/m\ensuremath{^2}) for buildings constructed between 1920 and 1945. Given the scalability of the model, it is readily applicable not only for the country as a whole but also for a province (canton), a city or a larger neighbourhood. The energy demand by archetype and building element identified with the SwissRes model can be used to assess the techno-economic potential of large-scale energy retrofit scenarios.},

When urban energy modelling is utilised as part of this process, the identification of building groups and associated representative buildings can play a critical role. This paper outlines a novel methodology for identifying building groups and associated representative buildings in urban datasets. The methodology utilizes a combination of building classification, building clustering and predictive modelling. First, multiple urban-scale datasets are collected, and then, classification techniques and clustering algorithms are applied to identify building clusters. Next, representative buildings (medoids) in each cluster are identified. Predictive modelling is used to expand cluster membership in the case where some buildings were excluded from the previous analysis. A number of different clustering algorithms are assessed, including K-means and hierarchical (agglomerative and divisive) and partitioning around medoids. The methodology is applied to a large dataset of mixed-use buildings in the city of Geneva, Switzerland. The results, assessed by nine validation indices, indicate the capacity of the decision support framework to identify clusters and associated representative buildings. Furthermore, post-application of predictive modelling, using a random forest approach, facilitates the incorporation of a larger portion of the building stock within the established clusters with an overall average classification accuracy of 89\%. A total of 67 representative buildings were identified in the urban dataset, which consisted of 13614 mixed-use buildings in the city of Geneva.},

	abstract     = {Global environmental problems have urged the need for developing sustainable technologies. However, new technologies that enter the market have often higher economic costs and potentially higher environmental impacts than conventional technologies. This can be explained by learning effects: a production process that is performed for the first time runs less smooth than a production process that has been in operation for years. To obtain a fair estimation of the potential of a new technology, learning effects need to be included. A review on the current literature on learning effects was conducted in order to provide guidelines on how to include learning effects in prospective technology assessment. Based on the results of this review, five recommendations have been formulated and an integration of learning effects in the structure of prospective technology assessment has been proposed. These five recommendations include the combined use of learning effects on the component level and on the end product level; the combined use of learning effects on the technical, economic and environmental level; the combined use of extrapolated values and expert estimates; the combined use of learning-by-doing and learning-by-searching effects and; a tier-based method, including quality criteria, to calculate the learning effect. These five complementary strategies could lead to a clearer perspective on the environmental impact and cost structure of the new technology and a fairer comparison base with conventional technologies, potentially resulting in a faster adoption and a shorter time-to-market for sustainable technologies.},

	abstract     = {Emerging technologies are expected to contribute to environmental sustainable development. However, throughout the development of novel technologies, it is unknown whether emerging technologies can lead to reduced environmental impacts compared to a potentially displaced mature technology. Additionally, process steps suspected to be environmental hotspots can be improved by process engineers early in the development of the emerging technology. In order to determine the environmental impacts of emerging technologies at an early stage of development, prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) should be performed. However, consistency in prospective LCA methodology is lacking. Therefore, this article develops a framework for a prospective LCA in order to overcome the methodological inconsistencies regarding prospective LCAs. The methodological framework was developed using literature on prospective LCAs of emerging technologies, and therefore, a literature review on prospective LCAs was conducted. We found 44 case studies, four review papers, and 17 papers on methodological guidance. Three main challenges for conducting prospective LCAs are identified: Comparability, data, and uncertainty challenges. The issues in defining the aim, functionality, and system boundaries of the prospective LCAs, as well as problems with specifying LCIA methodologies, comprise the comparability challenge. Data availability, quality, and scaling are issues within the data challenge. Finally, uncertainty exists as an overarching challenge when applying a prospective LCA. These three challenges are especially crucial for the prospective assessment of emerging technologies. However, this review also shows that within the methodological papers and case studies, several approaches exist to tackle these challenges. These approaches were systematically summarized within a framework to give guidance on how to overcome the issues when conducting prospective LCAs of emerging technologies. Accordingly, this framework is useful for LCA practitioners who are analyzing early-stage technologies. Nevertheless, further research is needed to develop appropriate scale-up schemes and to include uncertainty analyses for a more in-depth interpretation of results.},

	abstract     = {The current worldwide expansion of waste PCB (WPCB) deposits represents both a pressing environmental issue and an economic opportunity, fostering the development of numerous recycling processes across the world. An important input for designing such processes is the metallic content of WPCBs, which is assayed by grinding and leaching samples taken from the stack of WPCBs to be recycled. The content values come with substantial uncertainties, arising mainly from the uneven distribution of the metals within the structure of WPCBs. This study aims to quantify the effects on these uncertainties of the particle size, the mass of the sample digested and the number of digestion replicates. It focused on the abundance of six metals in WPCBs: Cu, Fe, Zn, Pb and Ni, and also Co, which is a critical element for the EU. A batch of 485 kg of WPCBs was put through several shredding and splitting steps to produce three fractions: one shredded to 2 mm, and two ground to 750 \ensuremath{\mu}m and 200 \ensuremath{\mu}m. From each sample, 16 samples of 0.5 g, 2 g or 5 g were digested in hot aqua regia. Bootstrapping of the results allowed the error around the mean content to be estimated, for each metal and for all the experimental conditions. Considering the largest sample masses and three replicated digestions, the uncertainties for Zn (resp. Ni) were reduced from 35\% to 10\% (resp. from 70\% to 10\%) when the particle size was reduced from 2 mm to 200 \ensuremath{\mu}m.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: The objective of this paper was to provide LCA practitioners with recommendations and a framework for upscaling emerging technologies by reviewing upscaling methods applied so far in ex ante life cycle assessment (LCA). Methods: Web of Science was searched for articles published between 1990 and 2019 (April) using different variations of the term ``ex ante LCA'' as keywords. Suitable studies were reviewed to understand the key characteristics and main methodological principles of upscaling methods. Results and discussion: A total of 18 studies were selected for literature review. Review results showed that most studies reported what a hypothetical upscaled technology would look like in the future. All studies described how they estimated data; they applied different data estimation methods, using process simulation, manual calculations, molecular structure models (MSMs) and proxies. Since the review results showed that most ex ante LCA studies followed similar upscaling steps, we developed a framework for the upscaling of emerging technologies in ex ante LCA consisting of three main steps: (1) projected technology scenario definition, (2) preparation of a projected LCA flowchart, and (3) projected data estimation. Finally, a decision tree was developed based on the review results that provides recommendations for LCA practitioners regarding the upscaling procedure in ex ante LCA. Conclusions: Our findings can be useful for LCA practitioners aiming at upscaling in ex ante LCA. We provide an overview of upscaling methods used in ex ante LCA and introduce a framework describing the steps involved in the upscaling process and a decision tree recommending an up-scaling procedure. The results show that in theory all data estimation methods described in this paper can be applied to estimate material flows, energy flows, and elementary flows (emissions and natural resource use). Finally, since different kinds of expertise are required for upscaling in ex ante LCA, we recommend that technology experts from different fields are involved in performing ex ante LCA, e.g., technology developers, LCA practitioners, and engineers.},

	abstract     = {Purpose and context: This paper aims to establish principles for the increased application and use of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). Sustainable development (SD) encompassing resilient economies and social stability of the global system is growingly important for decision-makers from business and governments. The ``17 SDGs'' emerge as a high-level shared blueprint for peace, abundance, and prosperity for people and the planet, and ``sustainability'' for supporting improvements of products and organizations. A ``sustainability'' interpretation--successful in aligning stakeholders' understanding--subdivides the impacts according to a triple bottom line or three pillars: economic, social, and environmental impacts. These context and urgent needs inspired the LCSA framework. This entails a sustainability assessment of products and organizations in accordance with the three pillars, while adopting a life cycle perspective. Methods: The Life Cycle Initiative promotes since 2011 a pragmatic LCSA framework based on the three techniques: LCSA = environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) + life cycle costing (LCC) + social life cycle assessment (S-LCA). This is the focus of the paper, while acknowledging previous developments. Identified and reviewed literature shows challenges of addressing the three pillars in the LCSA framework implementation like considering only two pillars; not being fully aligned with ISO 14040; lacking interconnectedness among the three pillars; not having clear criteria for results' weighting nor clear results' interpretation; and not following cause-effect chains and mechanisms leading to an endpoint. Agreement building among LCSA experts and reviewing processes strengthened the consensus on this paper. Broad support and outreach are ensured by publishing this as position paper. Results: For harmonizing practical LCSA applications, easing interpretation, and increasing usefulness, consensed ten LCSA principles (10P) are established: understanding the areas of protection, alignment with ISO 14040, completeness, stakeholders' and product utility considerations, materiality of system boundaries, transparency, consistency, explicit trade-offs' communication, and caution when compensating impacts. Examples were provided based on a fictional plastic water bottle Conclusions: In spite of increasing needs for and interest in SD and sustainability supporting tools, LCSA is at an early application stage of application. The 10P aim to promote more and better LCSA applications by ensuring alignment with ISO 14040, completeness and clear interpretation of integrated results, among others. For consolidating its use, however, more consensus-building is needed (e.g., on value-laden ethical aspects of LCSA, interdependencies and interconnectedness among the three dimensions, and harmonization and integration of the three techniques) and technical and policy recommendations for application.},

It is hence a major challenge to improve its energy performance.

The Belgian city of Leuven works towards this target and is even more ambitious, setting their goal on becoming climate neutral by 2050. The strategy investigated in this study is to increase the renovation rate by clustering renovations, which is challenging since the Belgian building stock is highly privatised. Based on a thorough literature study, this paper examines various methodologies for building stock modelling. The main focus is comparing the required input data with the data availability, handling the data gaps, and defining their influence on the model's accuracy. The findings are applied to Leuven by analysing the main drivers to cluster renovation measures. However, many data gaps appeared, leading to the selection of a GIS-enhanced archetype model enriched by energy data as the most suitable approach. To avoid misinterpretation due to differences in data quality, transparent reporting in stock modelling is recommended.},

Detailed analyses are elaborated with case examples and technical challenges. Our critical analysis demonstrates that compared with retired lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) batteries, LFP batteries do not contain the high-value elements such as Co and Ni, so the economic drive for LFP recycling is compromised although future market prospects are substantial. It is of great practical significance to develop low-carbon and cost-effective Li extraction technologies and regeneration processes for cathode materials to ensure a sustainable and stable development of the LFP battery and EV industry.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: Good background data are an important requirement in LCA. Practitioners generally make use of LCI databases for such data, and the ecoinvent database is the largest transparent unit-process LCI database worldwide. Since its first release in 2003, it has been continuously updated, and version 3 was published in 2013. The release of version 3 introduced several significant methodological and technological improvements, besides a large number of new and updated datasets. The aim was to expand the content of the database, set the foundation for a truly global database, support regionalized LCIA, offer multiple system models, allow for easier integration of data from different regions, and reduce maintenance efforts. This article describes the methodological developments. Methods: Modeling choices and raw data were separated in version 3, which enables the application of different sets of modeling choices, or system models, to the same raw data with little effort. This includes one system model for Consequential LCA. Flow properties were added to all exchanges in the database, giving more information on the inventory and allowing a fast calculation of mass and other balances. With version 3.1, the database is generally water-balanced, and water use and consumption can be determined. Consumption mixes called market datasets were consistently added to the database, and global background data was added, often as an extrapolation from regional data. Results and discussion: In combination with hundreds of new unit processes from regions outside Europe, these changes lead to an improved modeling of global supply chains, and a more realistic distribution of impacts in regionalized LCIA. The new mixes also facilitate further regionalization due to the availability of background data for all regions. Conclusions: With version 3, the ecoinvent database substantially expands the goals and scopes of LCA studies it can support. The new system models allow new, different studies to be performed. Global supply chains and market datasets significantly increase the relevance of the database outside of Europe, and regionalized LCA is supported by the data. Datasets are more transparent, include more information, and support, e.g., water balances. The developments also support easier collaboration with other database initiatives, as demonstrated by a first successful collaboration with a data project in Qu\'{e}bec. Version 3 has set the foundation for expanding ecoinvent from a mostly regional into a truly global database and offers many new insights beyond the thousands of new and updated datasets it also introduced.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: Manganese is a metal used extensively in everyday life, particularly in structural steel. Despite the importance of manganese as an essential alloying element in steel and stainless steel, the environmental profile of manganese alloys lacked globally representative, primary industry data. The International Manganese Institute (IMnI) and Hatch completed the first global life cycle assessment (LCA) of manganese alloy production, providing environmental benchmarks and a firm foundation of accurate data with which to inform other industry-led initiatives. Methods: The study compiled primary data from 16 ore and alloy producers worldwide, covering 18~\% of global ore production and 8~\% of global alloy production for 2010. This peer-reviewed, ISO 14040 compliant LCA covers the cradle-to-gate life cycles of silicomanganese, ferromanganese, and refined ferromanganese. The study provides a comprehensive picture of global environmental performance, quantifying energy consumption, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), primary water use, and primary waste generation. A novel model architecture was devised to generate process, site, and cradle-to-gate LCAs for single and multiple sites simultaneously, extracting greater value from the LCA process by facilitating environmental and operational benchmarking within the industry. Results and discussion: The results of the study show that total GWP, AP, and POCP for 1~kg of average manganese alloy was 6.0~kg CO2e, 45~g SO2e, and 3~g C2H4e, respectively. Electricity demand and coal and coke consumption during smelting are the dominant operating parameters contributing to environmental performance. On-site air emission measures (GWP, POCP, NOX, and particulate matter (PM)) contributed 25 to 35~\% of total life cycle emissions. Overburden and waste rock were the most significant primary solid waste flows by mass. The study provides a resource for improvement at the global industry and site scales by establishing benchmarks, identifying hotspots, and quantifying the benefits of efficiency savings through process optimization. Conclusions: This LCA provides accurate primary data to improve steel and stainless steel product LCAs and communicate the environmental performance of the industry in quantitative terms. It facilitates dialogue between manganese producers and consumers through a shared understanding of the environmental profile of the industry. Through leveraging the study to identify hotspots within the manganese supply chain, producers can work both independently and collectively towards improving the environmental and economic performance of manganese alloys.},

	abstract     = {Concurrent with the demand for cleaner, lighter, and more efficient vehicles, many scarce metals (SMs) are used in passenger vehicles because of their unique physical and chemical properties. To explore the recycling potential of these metals, it is important to understand their distribution in the vehicles as well as their fate at the vehicles end-of-life. However, this information remains very scattered and sparse. In this paper, we present a study investigating the distribution of 31 SMs in selected electrical and electronic (EE) components of conventional passenger vehicles and in the end-of-life vehicle shredder fractions from a shredder plant in Switzerland. The results of the chemical analyses show that the mass fractions of Co, Sn, Sr, Ta, Y, and Zr were dominant with >20 000 g/t in the selected EE components and Ag, Ga, Mo, Sb, Sn, Sr, and Zr with >50 g/t in the analyzed shredder fractions. The largest masses of 17 SMs were found in the shredder light fraction, which is incinerated in municipal waste treatment plants mainly in Switzerland; thus, these SMs are currently not recovered. The SM mass fractions in both the EE components and the shredder fractions were projected to their total masses in 100 hypothetical midrange passenger vehicles. The resulting mass balance showed a mismatch of >50\% for 23 metals, which indicates other important SM sources such as alloys.},

	abstract     = {Material stocks are an important part of the social metabolism. Owing to long service lifetimes of stocks, they not only shape resource flows during construction, but also during use, maintenance, and at the end of their useful lifetime. This makes them an important topic for sustainable development. In this work, a model of stocks and flows for nonmetallic minerals in residential buildings, roads, and railways in the EU25, from 2004 to 2009 is presented. The changing material composition of the stock is modeled using a typology of 72 residential buildings, four road and two railway types, throughout the EU25. This allows for estimating the amounts of materials in in-use stocks of residential buildings and transportation networks, as well as input and output flows. We compare the magnitude of material demands for expansion versus those for maintenance of existing stock. Then, recycling potentials are quantitatively explored by comparing the magnitude of estimated input, waste, and recycling flows from 2004 to 2009 and in a business-as-usual scenario for 2020. Thereby, we assess the potential impacts of the European Waste Framework Directive, which strives for a significant increase in recycling. We find that in the EU25, consisting of highly industrialized countries, a large share of material inputs are directed at maintaining existing stocks. Proper management of existing transportation networks and residential buildings is therefore crucial for the future size of flows of nonmetallic minerals.},

In literature, various methods have been employed to quantify the C\&D waste generation at both regional and project levels. However, an integrated review that systemically describes and analyses all the existing methods has yet to be conducted. To bridge this research gap, an analytical review is conducted. Fifty-seven papers are retrieved based on a set of rigorous procedures. The characteristics of the selected papers are classified according to the following criteria - waste generation activity, estimation level and quantification methodology. Six categories of existing C\&D waste quantification methodologies are identified, including site visit method, waste generation rate method, lifetime analysis method, classification system accumulation method, variables modelling method and other particular methods. A critical comparison of the identified methods is given according to their characteristics and implementation constraints. Moreover, a decision tree is proposed for aiding the selection of the most appropriate quantification method in different scenarios. Based on the analytical review, limitations of previous studies and recommendations of potential future research directions are further suggested. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract     = {The world is shifting to electric vehicles to mitigate climate change. Here, we quantify the future demand for key battery materials, considering potential electric vehicle fleet and battery chemistry developments as well as second-use and recycling of electric vehicle batteries. We find that in a lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide dominated battery scenario, demand is estimated to increase by factors of 18–20 for lithium, 17–19 for cobalt, 28–31 for nickel, and 15–20 for most other materials from 2020 to 2050, requiring a drastic expansion of lithium, cobalt, and nickel supply chains and likely additional resource discovery. However, uncertainties are large. Key factors are the development of the electric vehicles fleet and battery capacity requirements per vehicle. If other battery chemistries were used at large scale, e.g. lithium iron phosphate or novel lithium-sulphur or lithium-air batteries, the demand for cobalt and nickel would be substantially smaller. Closed-loop recycling plays a minor, but increasingly important role for reducing primary material demand until 2050, however, advances in recycling are necessary to economically recover battery-grade materials from end-of-life batteries. Second-use of electric vehicles batteries further delays recycling potentials.},

Here, we build a prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA) model for lithium-ion battery cell production for 8 battery chemistries and 3 production regions (China, US, and EU). The pLCA model includes scenarios for future life cycle inventory data for energy and key materials used in battery cell production. We find that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per kWh of lithium-ion battery cell production could be reduced from 41 to 89 kg CO2-Eq in 2020 to 10–45 kg CO2-Eq in 2050, mainly due to the effect of a low-carbon electricity transition. The Cathode is the biggest contributor (33\%-70\%) of cell GHG emissions in the period between 2020 and 2050. In 2050, LiOH will be the main contributor to GHG emissions of LFP cathodes, and Ni2SO4 for NCM/NCA cathodes. These results promote discussion on how to reduce battery GHG emissions.},

The evaluation indicators such as global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) and human toxic potential (HTP) are taken into account. The results show that the major environmental impact phase in pyro-metallurgy derives from beneficiation because of the largest material and energy consumption. It is also shown that copper hydrometallurgy has significantly lower environmental impact than pyro-metallurgy.
